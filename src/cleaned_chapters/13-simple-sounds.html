<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Beginning</em></p>
<h1>Simple Sounds</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You have a melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic idea in your head. But when you sit
  down at your DAW to try to capture it, you usually begin by trying to find or
  create the right sounds to match the idea. And somewhere along the way, the
  idea itself gets lost.
</p>
<p>
  As electronic producers, often our first instinct when starting a new song is
  to collect a palette of sounds before beginning work on the actual notes and
  rhythms. And modern synthesizer presets are often designed to sound like
  entire productions just when playing a single note, with huge layers of
  effects, embedded rhythmic activity, or both.
</p>
<p>
  But sometimes, this can be a distraction from your real goal, which is to
  create your own compelling musical ideas.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Instead of starting by trying to find the perfect sounds, try starting with
  the simplest sounds you can find. General MIDI or other “generic” presets are
  good for this exercise.
</p>
<p>
  Now, without taking time to tweak the sounds or add effects, just start
  working on notes and rhythms. It’s likely that everything will sound
  uninspiring at first, and this is OK. The hope is that by working this way for
  a while, you’ll come across musical ideas that are strong enough
</p>
<p>
  to transcend or overcome the sounds that play them. These ideas will have to
  be <i>really </i>good, since they won’t be able to hide behind
</p>
<p>
  impressive synth patches or layers of effects. But really good ideas are what
  we’re after—musical materials that are so strong that they inspire you on
  their own merits. Consider that whole symphonies have been written by
  composers who work entirely at the piano.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have a great collection of self-sufficient musical ideas, then you
  can start the process of finding great sounds to play them. As you were doing
  the hard part of the job—writing the music—you may have already had ideas
  about what kinds of sounds would be appropriate. This will make finding or
  creating the appropriate sounds even faster and more rewarding, because you’ll
  know that they fit your own musical ideas, rather than suggesting musical
  ideas that may be more a function of the inherent sonic properties of the
  sound.
</p>
<p>
  Although generic electronic sounds work well for this, an even better solution
  is to write using an acoustic instrument like a guitar or piano (if you play
  one). Acoustic instruments serve dual purposes here. As with General MIDI
  sounds, they help to get you out of sound-design thinking so you can focus on
  the music. But they also help you get out of DAW thinking entirely. By
  removing the computer from the picture for a while, we’re more likely to avoid
  distraction and really force ourselves to write with our ears instead of our
  eyes.
</p>

<p>
  Of course one challenge of working acoustically is that it makes it a little
  bit harder to capture great moments of inspiration that would otherwise
  automatically land in your DAW. In this case, it might help to set up a mic in
  the room and record everything you play as audio. Yes, it might take a bit
  more work to then sort out what you played later, but at least the ideas won’t
  be lost.
</p>
<p>
  This technique isn’t for every producer. If your music is fundamentally
  <i>about </i>sound design, then it’s possible that notes and rhythms aren’t
  much of a factor in your work at all. In such cases, these techniques will
  probably just waste time. But if you’re a producer working in a less
  experimental genre, starting with simple sounds might help you get to better
  music.
