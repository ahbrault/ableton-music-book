<h1>Listening to Music You Hate</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Although you listen to a lot of music, you tend to listen within a specific
  set of genres.
  And you pretty much exclusively listen to music that you like, or at least
  music that you expect you’ll like based on your previous experience, recommendations, etc.</p>
<p>Even if you write exclusively in a single genre, you owe it to yourself
  to spend some time listening to a wide variety of music. Here are some tips
  for how (and why) to listen to music that you may not enjoy.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Most people listen to music for entertainment. But producers and composers owe
  it to themselves to also listen in order to <i>learn something</i>.
  Inevitably, this will mean spending at least some time listening outside of
  your comfort zone, to music that you don’t like.
</p>
<p>
  This is more than just listening to genres that are closely related to what
  you normally listen to. For example, if you consider yourself primarily a
  techno producer, don’t be too proud of yourself if you
  occasionally listen to house music. It’s critical that you expand your range
  of listening to genres that you would never normally listen to for pleasure.
</p>
<p>Why is this important? As you listen, consider the following questions:</p>
<p class="s7">Are there musical techniques you can use?</p>
<p>
  If you write in only one genre (and especially if you listen to only one
  genre), perhaps you’ve developed a set of working techniques that’s fairly
  consistent and “appropriate” for the kind of music you make. This may work for
  you, but it also exposes you to the risk of writing the same music over and
  over. Other types of music may be made in entirely different ways, and perhaps
  there are techniques from those worlds that you can appropriate for your own
  use.
</p>
<p>
  As an example, consider opera (a genre that many electronic producers probably
  don’t spend a lot of time listening to). A single opera may last for hours—a
  time scale that’s closer to an entire DJ set than a single track. How does
  tension and release work over this amount of time?
</p>
<p>How does form work? What about harmony? Rhythm? Melody? Overall sound?</p>

<p class="s7">Are there production techniques you can use?</p>
<p>
  In addition to musical techniques, there is also a huge amount you can learn
  about production when listening to other genres.
</p>

<p>
  Consider country music, for example. Whatever you might think of this music as
  entertainment, there is no doubt that contemporary country music is generally
  extremely well-produced and borrows a lot of mixing and production concepts
  from contemporary pop music. But there are some significant differences. For
  example, vocals in country music are often much louder than vocals in pop
  music (or in electronic genres with vocals). Also, pop music (and many
  electronic genres) tends to be quite bass-heavy, while country tends to
  emphasize guitars and other mid-range instruments.
</p>
<p>
  Whether or not those production characteristics are useful in your own music
  depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. But simply being aware of what’s
  happening in a wide variety of styles might inspire your creativity or shake
  you out of your own stylistic ruts.
</p>

<p class="s7">Why do people like this?</p>
<p>
  No matter what you’re listening to, and no matter how terrible you think it
  is, someone out there loves it. And unless you’re writing music exclusively
  for yourself, it’s a useful intellectual exercise to try to understand why
  people like what they do. There are, of course, social
  pressures; people like things because they’re popular, or because their
  friends like them, or because they represent a recognized signifier for a
  particular subculture. But there are also genuine musical preferences which
  vary widely (and wildly) between people. Even if you have no intention of
  writing music for the opera or country music fan, thinking about how other
  music works, and why disparate groups of people like what they do, can help
  you become a more well-rounded musician, which can only improve your music.
