<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Music production with a computer offers a limitless field of possibilities.
  Any sound can be made, manipulated, re-recorded, re-manipulated, etc. But
  while an infinite range of options might sound appealing,
</p>
<p class="s16">
  it also means that decision making is hard. The more options you see, the more
  you need to make active choices about which ones to pursue and which ones to
  ignore.
</p>
<p>
  Limiting the field of possibilities isn’t just about making it easier to work.
  It’s also about making it possible to begin at all. If every possible starting
  direction is equally appealing, how could you ever choose one?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Apply arbitrary constraints before starting to work. Create a “narrow frame”
  of possibilities, and then act entirely within that frame. Applying arbitrary
  constraints helps to limit your field of options, allowing you to move
  forward.
</p>
<p>
  It’s important to note that these constraints really are arbitrary; you’re
  attempting to eliminate <i>perfectly valid </i>options rather than
  <i>bad </i>ones. Bad options are easy to deal with; your own musical
  sensibilities will reject them automatically. But valid options need special
  care because their validity requires you to make active choices about whether
  to pursue or reject them. Eliminating them arbitrarily helps you avoid
  decision paralysis. Also, the fact that the constraints are arbitrary means
  that it doesn’t really matter if you’re wrong. If you realize during the
  course of your work that you’ve constrained yourself too much, or in the wrong
  direction, you can simply choose to remove the constraint.
</p>
<p>
  Here are a number of ideas for arbitrary constraints, both related to the
  music itself and also to working method:

      >For example, the untitled Peter Gabriel album commonly called
      <i>Melt </i>has no cymbals. Prince’s classic song “When Doves Cry” has no
      bass line. These kinds of restrictions force your decision making process
      into new directions. If an entire functional role is missing, how do you
      fill the gap? In the case of <i>Melt</i>, Gabriel had to find ways to
      propel time forward without relying on mainstays like
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>hi-hats or ride cymbals. His solution was a range of unconventional</p>

<p>
  percussion instruments. In the case of “When Doves Cry,” Prince chooses to
  leave the sonic space unfilled. Consider both options in your own work.

      actually put a limit on that time. If you find self-imposed deadlines to

        >If you’re used to making music in a particular place, try moving to a
        different one. Simply moving from your bedroom studio to the local
        coffee shop forces your hand in a number of ways. First of all, you’re
        limited by what you can take with you—no racks of external hardware, for
        example. Secondly, you’re in an environment that is at least somewhat
        unfamiliar, so you’re unable to fully relax (and thus become
        distracted). Many musicians avoid having a home studio altogether,
        instead choosing to rent studio space so that they can separate their
        working mindset from their living mindset.</span

<p>
  Although you may not realize it at first, you’re most likely already applying
  certain constraints to your work. For example, simply making the choice to
  work within a specific genre already eliminates a huge range of musical
  possibilities. To say that you’re working on a “house track” as opposed to a
  “Balkan folktronica track” implies that you understand certain general
  characteristics (the instrumentation, rhythms, and harmonic language that
  identify a given piece of music as being “in” a particular genre) that
  describe one music as opposed to another.

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Sometimes during music-making, we find moments of amazing creativity and flow.
  But because we have in mind the ultimate end goal of “a great track,” we
  sometimes stop mid-flow to edit, correct, or otherwise disrupt the creation
  process. And once we
</p>
<p class="s16">do, it can be difficult to get back into the flow.</p>
<p>
  Creativity is an intrinsically messy and uninhibited process. Editing, on the
  other hand, is about refinement and order. “Write drunk; edit sober”—a quote
  often attributed (most likely incorrectly) to author Ernest Hemingway—uses
  drunkenness versus sobriety as a metaphor about levels of self-control and the
  importance of working both with and without restraint. Both modes of working
  are necessary to create something good, but problems can arise when we don’t
  keep a clear division between the two. Allowing them to overlap runs the risk
  of breaking our creative flow.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Force yourself to compartmentalize your work into two discrete phases. During
  the <i>creation phase</i>, your goal should be to capture as much material as
  possible. Only move forward in time. Delete nothing. Once you’ve recorded
  something, consider it finished. Better yet, forget about it entirely and move
  on to the next thing. Aim for speed and quantity, judge nothing, and be
  prepared to make lots of mistakes.
</p>
<p>
  Once you’ve captured a lot of material (maybe after a set amount of time, or
  simply once you get bored) switch to the <i>editing phase</i>. Now, your goal
  is to carefully refine the material that you generated during the creation
  phase. Resist the urge to generate anything new during this process, and
  instead ruthlessly delete, trim, reorder, or otherwise curate the material you
  made earlier. It’s likely that you’ll throw away the majority of what you
  made, and this is healthy. Most of what we make in a truly judgment-free
  creation mindset is likely to be terrible.
</p>
<p>
  A side benefit of working so freely during the creation phase is that you may
  find things during the <i>editing </i
  ><a href="#bookmark107" class="a"
    >phase that are actually amazing but are unusable within the context of the
    project you’re currently working on. When that happens, just save the
    material that’s worth saving (but is wrong for the current song) into a
    “scraps” folder (see Scraps and Sketches (page </a
  >74)). Then the next time you’re beginning a new
</p>
<p>
  track but aren’t in the mood to start from scratch, simply pull something
  interesting out of your scraps folder. Depending on how developed your scraps
  are, you might be able to pick one up and move directly into a new editing
  phase.
</p>
<p>
  A good technical approach to working during the creation phase is to always be
  recording. Even if you’re just improvising at the keyboard and have no plan or
  direction, be sure to capture every note you play. A common working method for
  electronic musicians is to use the DAW as the recording device but use
  hardware or other sources outside of the computer to generate sound. A
  collection of synthesizers generating MIDI and/or audio lets you get your
  hands on something that doesn’t
</p>

<p>
  feel like an editing environment, allowing you to step away from the DAW (and
  its inherent bias towards editing). Press record, then play and tweak knobs,
  capturing everything you do as a kind of free-form jam. While jamming, try to
  forget that you’re recording. Don’t try to make something perfect. Simply
  indulge in the uninhibited freedom of exploring sound. Follow your
  instincts—if something is working, let that lead you in a direction. If
  something isn’t working, abandon it, but do
</p>
<p>
  so <i>without </i>stopping the recording. The trick is to stay out of judgment
  mode as much as possible. Simply capture as much as you can, following your
  instinctive sense of what’s right. Don’t worry about hard drive space. If you
  really need to reclaim the space, you can do that later during the editing
  phase.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you work entirely in the computer, try to find some working methods
  that are somehow analogous to this physical division between instruments and
  editors. For example, maybe use one DAW as your creation space and another as
  your editing space. By treating these as distinct virtual environments, it may
  be easier to switch between the two modes of working. Alternatively, find a
  collection of instruments and effects that allow you to create lots of
  material in an evolving, organic, connected way. For example, modular
  synthesizers and arpeggiators, even virtual ones, can be great sources of
  material during the creation phase. Start your recording even before you’ve
  started building a modular patch, so that you can catch any happy accidents
  that occur on the way.
</p>
<p>
  If your DAW allows for comprehensive routing options between tracks, try
  capturing both MIDI and audio simultaneously during the creation phase. This
  will give you more ways to edit later and provide more
</p>
<p>
  raw fodder for refinement. It will also save time in the editing process
  because you don’t have to listen to everything twice—the MIDI and audio will
  contain analogous information, so you can listen through a single pass and
  then decide whether to rework the MIDI, the audio, or both.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="#bookmark168" class="a"
    >The balance between play (creation) and work (editing) is necessary to
    generate good results. Like Subtractive Arranging </a
  >(page 259),
</p>
<p>
  this approach works because it allows you to remove rather than create, and
  it’s much easier to decide that something is bad once it exists than it is to
  make something good from nothing. It saves you from having to make the “right”
  thing the first time, when you may be struggling to simply make anything at
  all.

  ~ Note: I wrote the first draft of this chapter in a text editor with an
  option called “Hemingway Mode,” which disables the Delete key. At the end of
  the creation phase, it was nearly 2000 words long. After editing, it’s about
  half that, and the paragraphs are almost completely reordered.
