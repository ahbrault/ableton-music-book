<h1>Choosing a Tempo</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re often not sure how to choose the right tempo for a track in progress.
  Does it really make a difference if your track is at 124 bpm rather than 125,
  for example? And why do some ranges of tempos seem to allow for much more
  musical flexibility than others?
</p>
<p>
  The choice of tempo depends on a variety of factors, including intended genre,
  intended audience, and (above all) personal preference. Here are some thoughts
  about tempo.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  If you already have a clear intention to write in a specific, well-
  established genre, then the range of “acceptable” tempos is probably already
  decided for you; tempo is one of the defining characteristics of genre. Here
  is a list of common tempo ranges for a number of electronic genres:
</p>
<ul id="l11">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Dub: 60-90 bpm</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Hip-hop: 60-100 bpm</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Downtempo: 90-120 bpm</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>House: 115-130 bpm</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Techno/trance: 120-140 bpm</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Dubstep: 135-145 bpm</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Drum and bass: 160-180 bpm</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that anything genre-related is not an exact science, and for each of
  these genres there are likely to be many exceptions and outliers.
</p>
<p>
  But as a general rule, if you’re deliberately working in one of these genres,
  choosing a tempo within these ranges should work.

    >So how do you decide on a more specific tempo? This is largely dependent on
    personal preference and musical context. Start with something in the middle
    of the range, but then try occasionally changing the tempo while working on
    the track and see if something just feels “right.” You can also try some of
    the techniques suggested in Deliberately Bad Listening (page </a
  >247) to see how the tempo feels
</p>
<p>
  in unusual monitoring contexts. Sometimes, a tempo will feel decidedly too
  fast or too slow when you listen from a different room, for example. And
  although the difference between, say, 124 and 125 bpm may be subtle, you may
  find that one is clearly preferable to the other for a particular context. If
  you don’t get that sense, however, then don’t spend more time than necessary
  worrying about it. Simply choose
</p>
<p>one and move on.</p>

<p>
  One interesting phenomenon that’s been happening in some recent dubstep and
  drum and bass is a sense of continuous or fluid shift between half-time and
  double-time. Because the range of tempos in these genres is relatively fast,
  music at half speed may sound appropriate when layered with music at the
  “actual” tempo. A drum and bass track that is predominantly at 170 bpm, for
  example, might
</p>
<p>
  work perfectly well with a sampled breakbeat at 85 bpm. This slow/fast
  dichotomy allows for a lot of creative flexibility when working in these
  genres.
</p>
<p>
  And of course, there are no rules when choosing tempo: The correct tempo is
  the one that makes the song work the best, and this is a creative decision
  only you can make.
