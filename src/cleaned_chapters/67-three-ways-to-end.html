<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Finishing</em></p>
<h1>Three Ways to End</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re staring at an arrangement that’s working, but you see no way to come to
  a convincing ending.
</p>
<p>
  Although endings are usually easier than beginnings, they can still be sources
  of considerable creative stress. After all, you’ve worked hard to build a
  strong arrangement that creates and resolves tension at the right times and in
  the right proportions. But all of this work could be lost if the ending
  doesn’t “wrap up” the song in a satisfying way.
</p>
<p>Here are three common ways to end songs.</p>

<h2>Solutions:</h2>

      Mirror what you did before<span class="p"

        of adding and subtracting layers.</span

      Parts enter to increase the textural density and energy and then are
      removed to create sections of reduced energy. One way to write a
      satisfying conclusion is to create a mirror image of the initial “part
      accumulation” phase of your track. For example, if your track begins with:
    </p>
    <ul id="l34">
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>kick drum alone (8 bars)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>add other percussion (8 bars)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>add bass line (8 bars)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>add harmony and melody (8 bars),</p>
        <p>you might then mirror this process to end the track as follows:</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>remove harmony and melody (8 bars)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>remove bass line (8 bars)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>remove other percussion (8 bars)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>kick drum alone (8 bars).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <h4>
      Loop and add/subtract<a href="#bookmark176" class="a"
        >. As discussed in Short Loops as Endings (page </a
      ><span class="p"
        >275), one way to end is to find a loop from somewhere in the song and
        simply repeat it. Insistence alone might be enough to drive the track to
        a convincing ending, but you can also experiment with increasing the
        sense of drive by adding additional layers at each loop repeat to build
        density and tension. On the other hand, you can also subtract or “thin
        out” parts at each loop repetition (possibly through the mirroring
        process discussed previously) in order to minimize energy and let the
        song end with a whimper rather than a bang. Both options work well, and
        the choice of which to employ depends on taste and musical
        context.</span

    <h4>
      Fade out<span class="p"
        >. Fade outs have negative connotations among electronic musicians,
        possibly because tracks with fades can be a bit challenging to use in
        the context of a DJ mix. But there are definitely situations in which a
        simple fade into silence is the right choice.</span
      >
    </h4>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  It’s important to note the philosophical implication of the fade out: It
  suggests to the listener that the song might actually never end.
</p>
<p>
  With this in mind, it probably only makes sense to fade out if you’ve settled
  into closing material that would really work well if left looping
  indefinitely. Jagged, asymmetrical, or otherwise “harsh” passages probably
  don’t make good material with which to fade out. Another important point to
  consider is where in the production process the fade out should be employed.
  If you plan to have your track mastered (or to master it yourself), it may be
  better to wait until the mastering stage to do the fade. This is because the
  sound of a mix fading can change dramatically depending on whether it happens
  before or after final mastering compression.
