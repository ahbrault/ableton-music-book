<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  From the perspective of a blank slate, the idea of “a great song” seems
  overwhelming and very far away. How can you possibly
</p>
<p class="s16">get from nothing to a complete package—</p>
<p class="s16">a finished song at the level of the music that inspires you?</p>
<p>
  You know that songs are made up of lots of parts, and the interplay of those
  parts is what makes music interesting. But how can you get an interesting
  interplay of multiple parts when you currently have <i>nothing at all</i>?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  The expression “a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” is
  clichéd but also totally applicable here. Thinking about a finished song from
  the perspective of a blank project is terrifying, and it’s a recipe for
  paralysis.
</p>
<p>
  So instead, forget about the song for now, and begin writing just one part. Of
  course, this is obvious: To begin, you have to begin! But treat this one part
  with the same kind of respect that you would a finished song. Instead of
  treating it like a building block, a task to accomplish, or a means to an end,
  try to focus on it as the goal itself. Before you even begin to think about
  adding more elements, make that one
</p>
<p>part amazing.</p>
<p>
  For example, imagine you’ll begin with drums (as many producers do). Instead
  of quickly sketching a pattern with stock sounds and sloppy timing before
  moving on to a bass line (also quickly sketched), spend the time necessary to
  completely finish the drums before adding any other elements.

    >If you’ve read other music-making tips (including the Breadth Before Depth </a
  >(page 92) chapter in this book), this may seem
</p>
<p>
  counterintuitive. We’re commonly told to write by sketching quickly and
  broadly—many parts, but in little detail—and then treat refinement and editing
  as something that is done in passes over all of this material.
</p>
<p>
  One Part at a Time proposes the opposite approach; instead of working
  <i>broadly</i>, work <i>deeply </i>on one element—and only one element—until
  it’s to a level that you would consider release-ready.
</p>
<p>This way of working can be valuable for a number of reasons:</p>

      It helps you to develop the skill of focus.
      <span class="p"
        >A single part can be thought of as a tiny version of a complete song.
        To be successful, both have to satisfy the same basic criteria: They
        should be sonically (technically) proficient, they should flow well over
        time, they should</span
      >
    </h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  remain interesting upon repeated listening, etc. Meeting these criteria over
  the course of minutes and with multiple tracks/parts is our ultimate goal, but
  if we can’t make this happen over the course of seconds and with a single
  part, we’re probably doomed. Making yourself finish something small helps you
  to learn what finishing feels like and helps you to internalize the steps
  necessary to get there. From there, finishing something larger is just an
  expanded version of the same process.

      One great part can reveal more great parts.
      <span class="p"
        >Although what’s being suggested here is to follow one idea to its end,
        another positive side effect of this working method is that one idea
        (especially one great- sounding, inspiring, and completed idea) can lead
        to others. Hearing a great drum part, with great sounding samples,
        perfectly placed notes, and attention to every detail, might make you
        start to imagine complementary bass lines, chords, or melodies.</span
      >
    </h4>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Of course, it’s important to remember not to be too strict in your thinking.
  (This is true for everything in this book!) If you find that you’re getting
  bored with working on drums and are inspired to work on a bass line instead,
  follow your inspiration and work on the bass line. But if you’re bored with
  working on one part and <i>aren’t </i>inspired to work on another one, try
  applying this technique as an
</p>
<p>
  exercise in discipline alone. And if this still isn’t working, consider the
  possibility that the part is unsalvageable—sometimes the best solution is to
  start over.
