<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Beginning</em></p>
<h1>Presets as Starting Points</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You can quickly make music using presets, loop libraries, sample packs, etc.
  But you’re not necessarily comfortable with this approach and are unsure about
  whether or not it’s “cheating.”
</p>
<p>
  There is a lot of disagreement and strong opinion about whether or not you can
  really take credit for your original music if you’re not also programming your
  own sounds. Some electronic musicians are also highly skilled synthesizer
  programmers and/or sample manipulators, and they talk with pride about how the
  first thing they do when
</p>
<p>
  they get a new piece of equipment is erase all of the presets. Often, the
  underlying philosophy behind this approach to composition emphasizes
  <i>sound </i>as the principal parameter of the music. Many musicians who focus
  intensely on sound design also work with a fairly restricted harmonic,
  melodic, and rhythmic palette. For them, it is timbre choices that largely
  define their artistic signature. This is
</p>
<p>common in, for example, minimal techno and some experimental styles.</p>
<p>
  On the other end of the spectrum are electronic musicians who have no interest
  in sound design and instead create their music entirely by assembling existing
  loops and samples. For these musicians, the focus is generally more on
  harmony, melody, and rhythm, and less on
</p>
<p>
  timbre. This is not to suggest that the sounds are arbitrarily chosen or used
  without care, but rather that there may be a range of acceptable sounds for a
  particular song part, and that the notes are given more compositional
  attention than the sounds. This is common in, for example, trance and some
  house music. In an abstract sense, this is also common in more conventional
  genres such as classical music or rock. In these genres, the available
  selection of instruments (and thus the essential palette of sounds) is
  generally a defining characteristic of the genre, and the composition is then
  largely about using those instruments in the service of melody, harmony,
  rhythm, and form.

<p>
  Which approach is the right one? Perhaps neither. Consider, instead, a middle
  ground between the two that can maximize musical
</p>
<p>
  productivity while minimizing the feeling that you’re not taking enough
  ownership of your music.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Instead of approaching sound design as an all-or-nothing endeavor, use
  presets, samples, and loops as the point of departure for each song part, but
  with the implicit understanding that you will devote some part of your
  music-making time to fine-tuning the sounds to suit your particular taste and
  needs. Purists may always start from a synthesizer’s default preset, but this
  feels like an unnecessary and time-consuming restriction. It means starting
  from the same state of controls, regardless of intended musical context, and
  then gradually
</p>
<p>
  tuning the sound “outwards” to gain distance from the default. Instead,
  consider beginning the writing process by using a preset that is at least in
  the same family as the instrument you’re writing for. If you’re working on a
  bass line, for example, explore your synthesizer’s bass presets—guilt free.
  Once you’ve found one that’s as close as possible to the sound you imagine in
  your head, work on the other parameters of the part: the melody, rhythm, etc.
  Then, after you have some music underway, come back to the sound again and
  begin tweaking it so that it takes on your own unique signature.
</p>
<p>
  For musicians with absolutely no sound design experience, this may sound like
  an intimidating process. But once you learn just the very basics of
  synthesizer theory, you’ll find that this knowledge can be applied to almost
  any synthesizer. For example, filters and basic ADSR envelope controls can be
  found on almost any hardware or software synth or sampler. And by using
  nothing more than these parameters— this is usually no more than six total
  controls—you can come up with a huge range of variations from a given preset.
</p>
<p>
  Commit at least enough of your music-making time to sound design so that you
  can be proud of the sounds you use. For the truly discerning electronic
  musician, it’s unlikely that any preset will ever be the perfect choice for
  their particular musical context. But it might be close. From there, you may
  need only a few tweaks before you’ve found something that is uniquely your
  own.
