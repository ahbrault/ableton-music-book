<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Beginning</em></p>
<h1>Different Tools</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Your studio tools are like a second home. You’ve become so comfortable with a
  particular set of possibilities and workflows that you’re able to easily get
  music made.
</p>
<p>
  But you’re not really happy with the results. Your work tends to follow
  predictable formulas, and you never seem to be able to expand your creative
  reach. You’re pretty sure that your next track will really just be a variation
  of your last one. And although you’re getting songs made, you don’t feel like
  you’re really making creative progress.
</p>
<p>
  Gaining a comprehensive understanding of a focused and limited set of tools
  can be a real creative benefit. Many highly organized electronic musicians are
  good at resisting gear lust and instead learn a particular DAW inside and out.
  These same producers are usually equally good at limiting their acquisition of plug-ins and virtual instruments, and
  instead use either the native devices in their DAW or select plug-ins and/or a small
  collection of boutique hardware.
</p>
<p>
  This strategy is powerful. It discourages activities like gear
  experimentation, which feel like music-making but which yield no results. And
  at the same time, it encourages deep understanding of the tools, which can
  help eliminate the need to reach for a tutorial in the middle of the creative
  process.
</p>
<p>
  But these self-imposed limitations can come with a hidden cost— limiting
  yourself to a concise set of tools may allow you to fall into the mindset of
  how those tools “think.” You may subconsciously begin to make the music
  suggested by your equipment rather than making the music you really want to
  make.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  <a href="#bookmark87" class="a">Even if you’re a seasoned veteran with years of experience and carefully
    thought-out reasons for choosing your studio tools, try making a track using
    a completely different set of tools. Try changing everything, from your DAW
    to your plug-ins to your hardware instruments. This is essentially the
    opposite approach to Mise en Place (page </a>29)—rather than carefully building a working environment, you’re
  deliberately
  discarding one you’ve already built.
</p>
<p>
  The goal here is to break yourself from routines you may not even realize you
  have. For example, if you’ve built templates or default presets in your DAW,
  no matter how much you change them in the course of writing a new track,
  you’re still beginning from the same fixed starting point every time. By
  completely changing your tools, you’re forced to work without these safe
  havens.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you’re forced to understand the <i>mindset </i>of these new
  tools. If you enter an unfamiliar creative space, your response to this lack
  of familiarity might manifest itself as a new creative direction.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you’re a software-only producer, try making a track using
  hardware synthesizers. Although software instruments can have a strong and
  unique sonic character, our interaction with them is fundamentally the same
  from instrument to instrument—we navigate each parameter using the same
  “controller”: a mouse or, at best, a generic hardware controller which is
  designed to be versatile rather than being focused.
</p>
<p>
  Hardware, on the other hand, offers a physical connection that has a unique
  physical identity which, in the best cases, is designed in tandem with the
  sonic identity of the instrument. A synthesizer from one manufacturer uses
  controls that feel different from those found on a synthesizer from another manufacturer. At some level, this tactile
  difference must influence the way we approach each instrument.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, every tool offers not only its own unique set of possibilities
  but also its own unique set of limitations and constraints. If you’re already
  comfortable with a particular set of tools, those limitations are well known
  to you, and you’ve probably stopped thinking about how they affect your daily
  work. But by exploring a new environment and following its constraints where
  they lead you, you’ll be forced to make a new set of creative compromises—and,
  in turn, open a new set of creative possibilities.
