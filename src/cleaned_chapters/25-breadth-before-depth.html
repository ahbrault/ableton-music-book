<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Progressing</em></p>
<h1>Breadth Before Depth</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Whenever you start making progress on a track, you suddenly become overwhelmed
  by the desire to get some particular aspect completely perfect. For example,
  maybe you’re preoccupied with getting the sound of your kick drum just right.
  Lots of time can be spent in this phase, and it often becomes frustrating,
  sapping your will to continue working on the track as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  Since you know that you’ll eventually have to refine every aspect anyway, can
  there be a downside to doing at least some of that refinement as you go?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Especially in the early and middle stages of your work on a track, when the
  ideas themselves may not exist yet, it can be detrimental to go into too much
  depth in any one particular area. Yes, you’ll need to do detail work
  eventually. But the idea-generation phase is vital and very, very fragile. By
  definition, it’s messy and doesn’t hold up well when confronted with outside
  pressures. Idea generation requires experimentation, risk-taking, unbounded
  thinking, etc. Detail work, on the other hand, is an entirely different kind
  of working process and requires an entirely different mindset. Detail work
  requires narrow,
</p>
<p>
  focused thinking. It’s often more about applying known processes than it is
  about exploring radical new directions.
</p>
<p>
  When you’re in idea-generation mode, it can be useful to work broadly—getting
  ideas out of your head and into the sequencer as quickly as possible—before
  working deeply on a single part. This way of working can be valuable for a
  number of reasons:

        >It helps you to learn how to listen for potential rather than for
        perfection. </b
      >During broad idea generation, parts might sound bad for a variety of
      reasons. Maybe you have a terrible mix balance, or the wrong sounds, or
      even some wrong notes. But you’ve drawn inspiration from music that has
      none of these problems—finished, mastered tracks have a professional sheen
      that’s miles ahead of where your particular track is right now. This can
      be discouraging, because even though we know that we can add polish at the
      end, we want to hear it <i>right now</i>. If your music doesn’t compare to
      your
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  inspiration at this moment, how can you be sure that you’re going in the right
  direction? The key here is to practice learning to listen past the
  imperfections: Instead of thinking “this bass line isn’t powerful enough,”
  think “this bass line <i>can </i>be powerful enough after some sound design
  work and mixing. But how are the notes?” By hearing past the immediate lack of
  impact, you become a better judge of whether or not a particular part (or the
  whole track) is going in the right direction.

      Creative time is short, and you have to move fast.

        >As mentioned previously, the idea-generation phase is fragile. It’s the
        one part of the music creation process that you can’t “force” to happen.
        This means that when it actually is happening, you need to squeeze out
        every idea that you can, working as quickly as possible and generating
        as much material as possible before your mind moves out of this phase.
        Once you’ve captured the ideas, the work of actually refining them can
        sometimes require much less truly creative energy.</span

  creative blocks may be solved in fundamentally different, and even opposing,
  ways.
