    <h1>Drums to Pitches and Vice Versa</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      Sometimes you have great ideas for drum patterns but aren’t able to find
      melodies or harmonies that fit. Other times, you have the opposite
      problem: You come up with great pitched ideas but can’t write drum parts
      that work with them.
    </p>
    <p>It’s common to write bits and pieces of songs in no particular order.</p>
    <p>

        >In fact, this kind of Goal-less Exploration (page </a
      ><a href="#bookmark107" class="a"
        >62) can be a great way to spend creative time without the pressure of
        needing to finish a song. And ideas created in this way can often be
        saved as Scraps and Sketches (page </a
      >74) to be revisited later. But sometimes, you really do want to finish
      the song but only seem to be able to compose one type of part.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      One of the greatest benefits of working with MIDI is that the notes of a
      musical idea are a completely different type of data than the sounds
      triggered by those notes. This means that the notes can be repurposed to
      play an entirely different sound. It’s common to create a bass line, for
      example, and then try it out through a number of different bass sounds
      before finding the one that fits the best. What’s less common, however, is
      using the MIDI notes created for one instrument to trigger a completely
      different category of instrument. And doing this can yield some really
      interesting results.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let’s take this drum pattern, which might be appropriate for
      house or related genres:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="511"
              height="131"
              src="/images/chapters/38-drums-to-pitches-and-vice-versa/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      By simply copying this clip to a track containing a pitched instrument, we
      end up with this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="511"
              height="131"
              src="/images/chapters/38-drums-to-pitches-and-vice-versa/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The resulting notes are “mapped” from the notes that triggered the
      appropriate drum sounds in the original clip. These sound a bit strange
      when played as they are. They’re quite low in pitch, so the resulting
      chords sound somewhat thick and muddy. Also, the actual pitches aren’t
      particularly harmonious (although this might be exactly what you want,
      depending on the music you’re making). But the pattern is rhythmically and
      structurally interesting, and there are a number of
      <a href="#bookmark123" class="a"
        >things we can do to make the notes work better (see Creating Variation
        3: Note Transformations </a
      >(page 108)), including simply transposing the whole pattern to a higher
      octave. Another way to get the notes to work together better is to
      selectively transpose some of them—either manually, by dragging them to
      new pitches, or automatically, through the use of some sort of
      scale-correcting MIDI effect (if your DAW has one). Now, in just a few
      steps, you’ve created a melodic or harmonic pattern that’s musically
      related to the drum pattern (because it’s rhythmically identical) and
      which might be useful as an idea in your song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, you can also follow this process in the other direction. If you
      have an interesting melodic or harmonic part, try copying the clip to a
      track containing drums. You’ll probably end up with a lot of strange drum
      choices, but you’ll likely get an interesting rhythmic pattern. By
      transposing the notes so that they play more appropriate drums, you might
      end up with an interesting drum part that you never would have written
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some DAWs and plug-ins allow you to analyze recordings of audio and
      extract the pitch and rhythmic information into new MIDI clips. While this
      functionality is normally used to extract specific types of audio
      recordings into similar types of MIDI recordings, you might get
      interesting results if you use the “wrong” algorithm when converting. For
      example, if you’re converting a piece of polyphonic audio, try telling
      your conversion utility that the material actually consists of drums
      instead. The tool will then try to figure out the pitches implied by the
      drums, which will likely result in harmonies that are completely
      unexpected (but which might be musically interesting).
    </p>
    <p>
      What’s exciting about these possibilities isn’t just that you can create
      lots of new ideas from a small amount of source material, but also that
      the resulting ideas will be musically connected to their sources. While it
      might be boring to simply play the same rhythmic idea in the drums and a
      pitched part simultaneously, having real musical connections between the
      two allows you to alter one or the other in a way that makes the new part
      unique but still identifiable as a “descendant” of the original part.
