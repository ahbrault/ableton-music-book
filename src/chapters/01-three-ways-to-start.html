<em hidden="true">Part: ‌Problems of Beginning</em>
<h1>Three Ways to Start</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re staring into the void of a new empty project in your DAW, and you have
  absolutely no idea how to begin.

    >The blank slate might be the most intimidating place in a creative
    environment. Once we’re in a flow, ideas tend to spawn additional ideas. But
    before we have anything, all options are available, so choosing seems
    impossible. One Part at a Time (page </a
  >44) is certainly a way to move forward, but which one part comes first? When
  you have nothing, even choosing one part can feel like an impossible hurdle.
</p>
<p>
  The simple-sounding answer is “It doesn’t matter how you start; just do!” This
  might work well as a sports slogan, but it’s perhaps too glib and dismissive
  to be really practical for creative work, in which the number of things to
  potentially “just do” are limitless and the path forward is not at all
  obvious. Here are three practical suggestions for how to begin from nothing.

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<ol id="l3">
  <li data-list-text="1.">
    <h4>
      Start with the foundation.
      <span class="p"
        >In most genres, we can think of the “bottom” of the music as being the
        low-pitched or purely rhythmic instruments, such as the bass and drums.
        On top of these are added instruments that are progressively higher in
        pitch. By starting with the bottom, we provide both a conceptual and
        musical foundation for everything else. The drums often provide the
        essential timekeeping elements, while the bass often provides the notes
        that define and anchor the chord progression. If you’re working in more
        experimental genres that don’t use these conventional instruments, it’s
        still likely that some elements can be considered foundational—perhaps a
        droning layer or something that approaches a repetitive rhythm.</span

    <h4>
      Start with what you hear.
      <span class="p"
        >Many musicians never (or rarely) get spontaneous musical ideas—all of
        their music comes from active work. If you happen to be lucky enough to
        hear original musical ideas in your head, then you should absolutely use
        them as the basis for your own work. For example, maybe you have a
        melodic idea that you’ve been humming, or a rhythm that you’ve tapped
        out on the table. Just because these ideas came to you outside of your
        active music-making context doesn’t mean you should discard them.</span
      >
    </h4>
    <p>
      On the contrary, these accidental ideas are sometimes the most interesting
      ones you can have.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text="3.">
    <h4>
      Start with what you know.
      <span class="p"
        >If you play a “real” physical instrument, try using it to generate your
        ideas. Even if you’re writing purely electronic music and have no plans
        to use instrument recordings in your work, your natural physical
        connection to your instrument may help you come up with more interesting
        and organic musical ideas than you can get from just working with a
        mouse and a MIDI controller. For example, guitarists tend to voice
        chords and approach harmony in a different way from keyboardists. But
        because keyboards are the de facto control surface for entering music
        into a DAW, many guitarists might never think to use their guitars in an
        electronic music context. Drummers rarely play the kind of beats that
        are used in many types of electronic music, but sitting behind a real
        drum kit might stimulate creative ideas that would feel alien on a pad
        controller. The trick with this approach is being able to accurately
        translate the acoustic idea to the electronic medium, but that’s a good
        problem to have; much better than having no ideas at all.
