<h1>Asynchronous or Polyrhythmic Loops</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Many electronic genres make extensive use of loops. When you listen to your
  favorite examples of loop-based music, there’s always some sense of motion
  that keeps the music fresh and interesting, but your own attempts to work this
  way usually strike you as static and boring.
</p>
<p>
  It seems like a paradox, but “simple”-sounding loop-based genres like minimal
  techno can be difficult to emulate. All of the elements are on the surface,
  and it’s easy to hear through the few layers of production. But although the
  surface level of much of this music suggests that there isn’t much happening,
  there’s a subtlety and richness of detail at work that separates the good
  music from the bad.
</p>
<p>
  Our typical mental model of a sequenced MIDI loop in a DAW is something like
  this: An instrument is played by one looping clip with a fixed length
  (probably equal to one or more complete bars). At some point, we might stop
  this clip and then start another clip in its place. So at any moment, any
  given instrument is either silent or is being triggered by one clip.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s a different way of thinking about looped clips that might make things
  more interesting.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Instead of triggering an instrument with a single clip, try simultaneously
  triggering it with multiple clips of different lengths. In most DAWs, this
  will require some kind of inter-track routing. For example, one track could
  contain the instrument, while one or more additional tracks contain no
  instruments but instead only the clips that will play the instrument on the
  first track. These “silent” clips will then have their output routed to the
  first track.
</p>
<p>
  In this example, imagine an instrument is triggered by a simple looping MIDI
  pattern consisting of four sixteenth notes:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/images/chapters/30-asynchronous-or-polyrhythmic-loops/image-1.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Simultaneously, the same instrument is being triggered by another loop that
  contains one sixteenth note followed by four sixteenths of silence. This
  pattern loops every five sixteenths; it is one sixteenth longer than the first
  pattern, so they will play out of sync with each other but in time with a
  shared pulse, a phenomenon known as <i>polyrhythm</i>.
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/images/chapters/30-asynchronous-or-polyrhythmic-loops/image-2.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The simultaneous juxtaposition of these two patterns creates an interesting
  auditory phenomenon. The ear can now hear three simultaneous patterns: the two
  that are actually being played and the resulting composite, which finally
  comes back into sync every 20 sixteenth notes:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/images/chapters/30-asynchronous-or-polyrhythmic-loops/image-3.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Here are some variations on these concepts:</p>
<ul id="l23">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Try adding more loops of differing lengths. For example, adding a third
      loop to the earlier example that repeats every three sixteenth notes will
      create a composite that is three times as long; the original patterns will
      realign after 60 sixteenth notes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Rather than letting the composite naturally realign, you could
      “artificially” realign it anywhere in an arrangement by simply pasting the
      clips so they begin at that point.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Some DAWs allow automation to loop at a length that is “unlinked” from the
      length of the notes in the clip. For example, you could create an envelope
      that varies a synthesizer’s filter cutoff and have this envelope loop at
      yet another length from the loops containing notes. Even if your DAW
      doesn’t have this functionality within clips, you could manually create
      repeating automation patterns of any length when you build your
      arrangement.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Similarly, if you have some kind of modulation source that can control
      parameters (like an LFO, for example), you could set this to a rate which
      is again asynchronous in relation to the looping notes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      If you’re using a plug-in instrument, try using duplicates of the
      instrument with slightly altered timbres, rather than actually using the
      exact same instrument. This will weaken the sense of a single composite
      pattern but may be more interesting anyway. You could even use this
      technique with hardware synths, provided you have enough of them (or
      you’re willing to bounce to audio after recording each pattern
      separately).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      When set against other instruments that are playing in more standard loop
      lengths, even a single “odd” loop can create the same kind of interesting
      effects. This approach is common in a lot of early acid tracks; listen to
      almost anything by Hardfloor for examples.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Layering of simultaneous asynchronous loops is a common hallmark of the
  so-called “Berlin School” of electronic music from the 70s and 80s, which was
  largely defined by multiple modular sequencers, each playing a monophonic loop
  consisting of a different number of notes.
</p>
<p>
  A similar technique can be found in ambient pieces such as Brian Eno’s
  <i>Music for Airports</i>, which is made from multiple tape loops of different
  lengths. This “analog” approach to the concept is truly asynchronous— if
  played forever, uneven tape loops are unlikely to ever resynchronize. You
  could achieve a similar effect in your DAW by offsetting one of your loop
  lengths so that it’s not quite aligned to the metric grid. Try playing with
  the amount of offset until you find relationships which sound interesting.
  This can create some very unusual rhythmic effects.
