<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You feel like your music lacks the “fullness” of the music that inspires you.
  But your attempts to solve the problem often end in music that just feels
  cluttered or messy.
</p>
<p>
  It’s tempting to think of a song as being something like an unlimited physical
  space, and that the way to fill the space involves adding more stuff. But in
  reality, musical space has boundaries, like a canvas:
</p>
<p>
  There is a limit to how much you can add before you’re simply covering
  something that’s already there.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  On the production side of music-making, it’s common to hear about “making
  space” for each element in your mix. Normally, this means eliminating
  overlapping frequencies by using EQ to carve out a band of frequencies in one
  instrument that you’d like to be more dominant in another. But the same
  process can be applied on the composition side as well (and may even save you
  from having to do EQ surgery afterwards).
</p>
<p>
  If your music feels “small” or “weak” or “lacking power,” the real solution
  may be to take parts away rather than to add more. It may feel
  counterintuitive, but the reality is that each part you add requires the
  others to fight that much harder for your listener’s attention. Of course,
  this paring-down strategy only works if the parts you have are as good as they
  can be. But if you allow yourself to fill musical space by adding parts, you
  run the risk of treating each part with less care than you might otherwise,
  rather than really investing the time and energy into getting a few elements
  to be perfect.
</p>
<p>
  This is <i>not </i>an argument for minimalism or for any kind of specific
  approach to genre. There’s plenty of “minimal” music that fits that
  description because of factors other than textural density. Music with a slow
  rate of change, for example, is often heard as minimal, regardless of how many
  elements are happening. Likewise, plenty of maximally active and seemingly
  dense music (such as some commercial EDM) can still sound clear and open
  because of a conscious effort to limit the number of simultaneous parts. The
  important point is to add parts as necessary, but <i>only </i>as necessary,
  and to be ruthless about removing things that aren’t really contributing to
  the music.
</p>
<p>
  A sense of “fullness” can usually be created by carefully balancing just a few
  things. If each part is placed in its own space, both in terms of composition
  and production, then a song has a better chance of feeling “complete” than it
  does if many parts are competing for the same space.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to brute-force removal of entire parts, you can often get good
  results by “thinning out” certain elements. Techniques for this include
  reducing the number of notes played by a particular instrument or shortening
  the decay time of sustained sounds so that they quickly get out of the way of
  the rest of the mix.

    >If you employ processes such as Arranging as a Subtractive Process (page </a
  ><a href="#bookmark161" class="a">259) or Maximal Density (page </a>244), you
  may have inadvertently created music that suffers from problems of over-
  layering. In these cases, you may need to do lots of erasing in order to get
  back to something that makes sense for your song. This is not to suggest that
  those processes don’t work, but rather that you’ll need to be extra careful
  and really think about whether or not you’ve removed enough to keep the song
  musical.
