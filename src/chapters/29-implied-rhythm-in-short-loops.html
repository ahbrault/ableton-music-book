    <h1>Implied Rhythm in Short Loops</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You keep making the same kinds of beats over and over again, and you’re
      looking for a way to expand your palette of rhythmic ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often develop a “vocabulary” of musical ideas that we rely on to create
      new music. Like spoken language, the richness of our musical expression is
      directly related to the depth of this vocabulary. When we know only a few
      words, we can say only a few things. Likewise, when we know only a few
      musical patterns, we’re limited in our ability to create music that’s
      different from the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most obvious place to get ideas for new beats is from other music, but
      here’s an idea for finding rhythms in another way.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Find or make an audio recording of anything. You’ll get the best results
      from material that has at least some variation over time; a steady-state
      sine wave probably won’t work well for our purposes here, but almost
      anything else is a viable source. It should be at least a few seconds
      long, but beyond this there are no restrictions on length. Very long
      material—minutes, hours, etc.—is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Import this audio into your DAW and create a loop around an arbitrary
      portion of it. Now, while listening, begin to decrease the length of the
      loop until it’s at most a few seconds long. One- or two-second loops seem
      to work best for this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you continue to listen carefully to this loop for a while, you’ll start
      to notice rhythmic patterns emerge. These are the result of our inherent
      ability to find patterns in chaos, like hearing the sound of a ringing
      phone in the white noise of a shower. The phenomenon of finding patterns
      in unordered stimulus is known as <i>pareidolia</i>. For example, most
      people see a “face” in this image of a natural rock formation on Mars.

        <tr>
          <td>
            <img

            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The bits and pieces of sound that make up the perceived rhythmic patterns
      may be the result of technical “errors” in your sample playback tool, such
      as loop boundaries that aren’t aligned with zero- crossing points in the
      sample. For our purposes here, these errors are exactly what we want;
      don’t try to fix them by enabling features with names like “snap to
      zero-crossings.”
    </p>

    <p>
      If your original source material already had a clearly defined rhythm or
      tempo, try to loop a portion of the material that plays against this in a
      clearly audible way. For example, make the loop so that the repetitions
      are not synchronized with the original tempo. The goal isn’t to make use
      of the overt rhythms that exist in the large-scale source material, but
      rather to discover the rhythms that emerge from the repetition of tiny
      portions.
    </p>
    <h4>Good sources include:</h4>
    <ul id="l22">
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          Existing music (ideally by you or by someone from whom you’ve secured
          rights, but anything can work technically). Remember, however, that
          you’re not looking for the musical information from the original
          source. The goal is to find the implied rhythm heard only when
          listening repeatedly to tiny fragments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          Field recordings of any kind—urban, industrial, or nature sounds work
          quite well for this.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          Recordings of speech. Rhythmic patterns emerge quite naturally from
          repeated fragments of speech. In fact, melodic patterns tend to emerge
          from short speech loops as well. For an interesting example of this in
          practice, listen to Steve Reich’s <i>Different Trains </i>for string
          quartet and tape. For this piece, Reich listened for the implied
          melodies in short fragments of speech and then transcribed them to be
          played by the stringed instruments.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ~ <i>Bonus: </i>In addition to audio, you can also use this technique with
      your own MIDI recordings, particularly if you’ve recorded extended
      improvised material without a metronome. Again, try to adjust the loop so
      that it plays against any rhythm or tempo that’s suggested by the original
      material itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once these rhythms have emerged from the loop, there are several different
      ways you can proceed. The most obvious is to simply use the looped sample
      as an element in your song. For an interesting example of this, listen to
      Machinedrum’s “Baby It’s U” from the album
      <i>Vapor City</i>, which uses hydrophone recordings of dolphins and shrimp
      as both the basis of the groove and as a rhythmic backdrop over which more
      conventional drums are eventually added. Another solution is to apply the
      emergent rhythms from the original sample to another instrument, as in the
      previously mentioned string quartet <i>Different Trains</i>.
