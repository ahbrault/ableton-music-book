<h1>Common Forms 2: Layering as Form</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You have no problem creating musical ideas, but you find it difficult to
  organize those ideas into an arrangement that makes sense. You’ve heard terms
  like “buildup,” “breakdown,” and “drop” to describe the sections of some
  songs, but you’re never quite sure what these words really mean or whether or
  not they’re relevant to your own musical work.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding how layering and textural density work can help your
  understanding of the music you hear, as well as provide options for the music
  you write.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  <a href="#bookmark172" class="a"
    >In contrast to the structure of song forms (see Common Forms 1: Elements of
    Song Form (page </a
  >269)), many of the more “pure” electronic genres (such as some techno,
  trance, dubstep, etc.) avoid the use of sectional designs altogether. Instead,
  a sense of form in these genres is often established by continuous variation
  of textural density around a relatively small amount of material—what would
  sometimes comprise only a single section in more pop-oriented genres.
</p>
<p>
  For example, in modern genres such as American dubstep, a single basic
  collection of material is often used from the beginning to the end of the
  track. Contrast, then, is created through layering: the careful addition and
  subtraction of parts in order to change the density of the underlying texture.
  There are a handful of terms that are commonly used to refer to the various
  parts of a song constructed in this way.
</p>
<p>These terms include:</p>
<h4>
  Buildup<span class="p"
    >: A track’s buildup is a section—usually 16 or 32 bars in length, or some
    multiple of those—in which layers are added, increasing the music’s textural
    density and perceived sense of energy. Buildups should create a sense of
    drive and forward motion and should end at a high point.</span
  >
</h4>
<h4>
  Breakdown<span class="p"
    >: The breakdown is a section of lower energy, designed as a contrast to the
    buildup, and involves either a gradual or sudden reduction in density.
    Breakdowns are about removing elements with the goal of creating a sense of
    space. Some common breakdown techniques include removing all of the drum
    elements or, conversely, removing everything except drums. Breakdowns are
    often shorter than buildups but are commonly still in increments of 8 or 16
    bars.</span
  >
</h4>
<h4>
  Drop<span class="p"
    >: The drop is the climax and is generally the most texturally dense passage
    of music in the track. The drop can occur after either a buildup or a
    breakdown, depending on the overall energy contour you’re trying to achieve.
    There are generally no more than one or two drops in a single track,
    although there are commonly more buildups and breakdowns.</span
  >
</h4>

<p>
  Although the musical results are radically different and significantly more
  subtle than in American dubstep, similar types of layering principles occur in
  a variety of other electronic genres as well.
</p>
<p>
  Consider, for example, classic dub techno tracks like those released by labels
  such as Chain Reaction. In most of this music, there is no sense of sectional
  contrast. A bass line or drum pattern that appears at the beginning of the
  track is likely to appear throughout the entire track, and if new material is
  introduced at some point, it is an addition to the surrounding material rather
  than a large-scale replacement of it.
</p>
<p>
  Layering as a form-defining process doesn’t work for every kind of music. If
  you’re working in genres that are closely related to pop music, you will
  probably benefit from using the more conventional elements
  <a href="#bookmark172" class="a"
    >of song form (see Common Forms 1: Elements of Song Form (page </a
  >269)). But for many types of “classic” electronic music, using a small amount
  of material subjected to ever-changing levels of textural density can be
  enough to create a sense of structure.
