<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Beginning</em></p>
<h1>Problem-Solving as Distraction</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Every time you go to make music, you realize that there’s something wrong with
  your setup; a plug-in you need isn’t authorized, or you forgot to download a
  sample pack that you purchased, or your chair isn’t comfortable. You dream of
  the day when
  you can hire a studio assistant to take care of all of the busy work that
  seems to be in your way every time you want to make music. But until then,
  you’re not sure how to get anything done when all of these problems keep
  coming up. How do other people do it?
</p>
<p>
  Technical problems in the studio can really kill the creative flow. Similarly,
  realizing that you don’t fully understand a particular production process or
  how to use a particular piece of gear can be frustrating—particularly when you
  had planned to use those things in the course of your current song. When faced
  with these situations, here’s how to get work done anyway.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>Ignore these problems. They’re not as important as you think.</p>
<p>
  Steven Pressfield, in his classic book <i>The War of Art</i>, talks about a
  force that manifests in the life of creative people in order to keep them from
  getting work done. He calls this force Resistance. These problems you’re
  finding in your studio are a manifestation of Resistance. It’s a trap! Your
  mind is playing tricks on you to try to keep you from working. None of these
  problems are serious enough to take time away from your creative efforts. If
  they were, you would have solved them already, during your non-productive
  time. The only reason you notice them when you sit down to work is that part
  of you doesn’t want to sit down to work.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="#bookmark114" class="a">Technical problem solving, education, motivational reading (including this
    book), and other forms of work-related activities will never write music for
    you. They’re important, but as discussed in On Work (page </a>89), they’re nowhere near as important as actually
  <i>doing the work</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Your creative time is essential; you should treat it with care and recognize
  when you’re subconsciously trying to avoid it. If you suddenly realize that a
  plug-in you need isn’t authorized, then use another one. You don’t need it
  right now. You’ve made music without it before, and you can make music without
  it now. If you forgot to download a sample pack you purchased, use some
  samples you already have. If your chair isn’t comfortable, work anyway. You
  can fix your chair on your next break or when the song’s done (whichever comes
  first).
</p>
<p>
  Nothing seems to stimulate the need to learn production techniques like
  sitting down to work. Do you really need to learn more about EQ
</p>
<p>
  or compression right now? Watch tutorial videos later; now is the time to
  work.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="#bookmark87" class="a">This is not to suggest that learning and problem solving aren’t important.
    It’s just that they belong to a different type of working time. The chapter
    Mise en Place (page </a>29) discusses the importance of setting up your environment to be maximally
  conducive to getting work done. But as important as this is, it’s even more
  important that it be done at the right time. And the right time is
  <i>never </i>when you’re in the creative mindset.
</p>
<p>
  Music-making time is sacred. Don’t stop to learn and don’t stop to fix
  something unless it’s absolutely critical. Use what you have and know, right
  now, to keep going forward.
