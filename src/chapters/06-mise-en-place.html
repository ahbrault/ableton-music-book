<h1>Mise en Place</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Getting into a creative mindset is hard enough, but once you’re in it,
  something inevitably goes wrong. DAWs crash, plug- ins need to be updated,
  you’re missing samples you absolutely need, you’re out of coffee, the dog
  needs to be walked, etc. And once you’ve fixed all of the problems, huge
  amounts of time have gone by and your creative impulse is gone.
</p>
<p>
  There are many things that can impede progress in the studio. Some of these
  things are legitimate issues (like equipment that suddenly fails), while
  others are distractions that we’re able to convince ourselves are important
  enough to get in our way (like a new email).
</p>
<p>
  But because the creative impulse is so fleeting, it’s vital that we’re able to
  actually get music made when ideas come. This means making sure that
  everything we’ll need to work is set up and ready to go beforehand, so that we
  can focus when we need to. Here are some ideas.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  The term <i>mise en place </i>(roughly translated from French as “put in
  place”) comes from the culinary world and refers to the careful preparation
  that goes into setting the physical (and mental) space prior to the actual
  work of cooking. This means making sure that the tools and ingredients you’ll
  need are easily at hand, the kitchen is clean and safe for use, and you’ve
  thought ahead to the end of the recipe to ensure that nothing unexpected will
  stop you once you’ve started.
</p>
<p>
  There are clear parallels between work in the kitchen and work in the studio,
  and employing mise en place as part of your music-making process can help you
  stay focused when inspiration strikes.
</p>

<p class="s7">Prepare Your Ingredients</p>
<p>
  Are your DAWs and plug-ins up to date? Do you have the samples you need? Are
  they named and organized in such a way that you can find them without needing
  to go on a time-consuming (and inspiration- destroying) search through all of
  your hard drives? Just as importantly, are the samples you <i>don’t </i>need
  out of your way and easy to avoid? Are your controllers, audio interface,
  headphones, and speakers connected and working? Does any hardware need
  drivers? If you’re using external instruments like synthesizers or effects,
  are they patched in and turned on? If you’re using acoustic instruments like
  drums, are the mics set up and working?
</p>

<p class="s7">Prepare Your Workspace</p>
<p>
  Is your chair comfortable? Is your desk uncluttered? Can you physically access
  any necessary hardware? If you’re collaborating with other people, are they
  plugged in and ready to make noise? Are they comfortable and also in a
  creative mindset?
</p>

<p class="s7">Prepare Yourself</p>
<p>
  Are you hungry or thirsty? How about any animals or children you’re
  responsible for? Is there a critical phone call you need to make or email you
  need to send? Are your neighbors or roommates going to be bothered by the
  sound you make?
</p>
<p>
  Nothing kills the creative flow more than having to stop and solve a
  non-creative problem. Making sure that these factors are dealt with ahead of
  time means that you’re able to fully embrace the music- making process, with
  less risk of distraction.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to employing mise en place prior to starting work, there are some
  additional kinds of preparation and organization actions you can take that
  will help you be ready when inspiration strikes:
</p>

<p class="s7">Make Templates</p>
<p>
  If you find that there are particular combinations of instruments or sounds
  that you’re using often, save empty template projects with those instruments
  already loaded so that you can be ready to start creating as soon as you have
  an idea. For example, if you switch between your own solo work and working
  with other musicians, save a template for each scenario rather than rebuilding
  these environments from your DAW’s default project over and over again. The
  goal is to get from idea to actual creation as quickly and effortlessly as
  possible.
</p>

<p class="s7">Organize as You Go</p>
<p>
  Even a well-prepared environment can quickly fall into chaos during the heat
  of the creative moment. As you’re working, try to stay as organized as you can
  (but without falling out of music-making). For example, name tracks before you
  record onto them, both so you can see at a glance what you’re working on, and
  also so newly created clips on those tracks “inherit” useful names. If your
  DAW allows it, use color to create visual associations between related clips
  or tracks. And throw away anything that you’ve definitely decided not to use.
  Removing clutter from your project helps you to focus on the important things
  that remain (and may also reduce your CPU load or memory usage).
</p>

<p class="s7">Always Be Ready to Capture</p>
<p>
  Great ideas might come to you when you’re outside of the studio. Ideally,
  you’re always prepared with a field recorder or a smartphone app to quickly
  capture interesting sounds, or even melodic or rhythmic ideas that you can hum
  or sing before you forget them. You can even use a notebook to capture
  ideas—in musical notation or in text, pictures, or any other system that will
  allow you to remember it. The important thing is that you have these capturing
  tools with you at all times.
</p>
<p>
  Although mise en place can be a huge productivity boost, make sure that you
  find time for this preparation work that is not the same as your creative
  time. Don’t start getting organized when you’re actually inspired to make
  music. If you feel like making music, that should always take priority. It’s
  much harder to find the energy to be creative than it is to find energy for
  mise en place, which you can make yourself do anytime. And it’s much better to
  act quickly on a creative impulse— even if you’re completely unprepared—than
  it is to postpone it, try to get organized, and then find you’ve lost your
  motivation. Use the time when you’re <i>not </i>inspired to take care of mise
  en place.
