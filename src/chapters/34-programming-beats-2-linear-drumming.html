    <h1>Programming Beats 2: Linear Drumming</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      Your programmed drum beats tend to use the available instruments in
      “expected” ways: Hi-hats keep time, kick drums emphasize the beats,
      snares/claps are placed on or around the backbeats (beats 2 and 4). But in
      the music you admire, you sometimes hear other, more creative ways of
      working with drums. Sometimes it almost sounds like the drums are playing
      a “melody” of their own. But when you try to create patterns like this, it
      just sounds random and chaotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various instruments in a drum kit have a tendency to be used in a
      somewhat standardized way. This is true across a variety of genres, both
      acoustic and electronic. For example, here’s a very basic rock and roll
      drum pattern:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="159"
              src="/images/chapters/34-programming-beats-2-linear-drumming/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The kick drum plays on every beat, the snare on the backbeats, and the
      hi-hats on every eighth note.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be converted into a very basic house pattern simply by removing
      all of the hi-hat notes that appear on strong beats (leaving only the
      offbeat eighth notes):
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="159"
              src="/images/chapters/34-programming-beats-2-linear-drumming/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      One of the hallmarks of these kinds of conventional drum patterns is that
      they’re <i>polyphonic</i>—multiple instruments can play at the same time.
      For a human drummer with four limbs, there’s a maximum possible polyphony
      of four simultaneous “voices.” Of course in the electronic realm, there’s
      no such limitation, although experienced drum programmers who are working
      in styles that are meant to mimic acoustic drums will generally stick with
      this four-voice limitation in order to create parts that sound as
      realistic as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A side effect of thinking about drum patterns as polyphonic textures is
      that we tend to treat at least one layer as unvarying. In the grooves
      discussed earlier, for example, note that each individual instrument
      maintains a symmetrical pattern that never changes. In many musical
      contexts, these kinds of simple, steady patterns are completely
      appropriate. But here’s another way of writing drum patterns that can
      yield some interesting results.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Acoustic drummers (particularly in some funk, R&amp;B, and fusion
      contexts) sometimes use a type of playing called <i>linear drumming</i
      ><a href="#bookmark145" class="a"
        >. This simply means monophonic—no two instruments can play at the same
        time. Linear drumming is similar to the melodic technique called hocket
        (see Linear Rhythm in Melodies (page </a
      >190)). An extremely simple linear drumming pattern derived from the
      previous examples might look like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="158"
              src="/images/chapters/34-programming-beats-2-linear-drumming/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      But rather than just taking a conventional pattern and removing
      overlapping elements, try thinking about how to use the monophonic
      requirement in creative ways. For example, treating a monophonic drum part
      as a single, quasi-melodic line of notes may cause you to think of each
      instrument as having the same level of importance, rather than
      subconsciously assigning them to functional roles (like “timekeeping” or
      “accenting”). Consider the following pattern:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="505"
              height="155"
              src="/images/chapters/34-programming-beats-2-linear-drumming/image-4.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      In the above pattern, sub-patterns in groups of three notes play against
      the expected flow of time, before “correcting” with a two-note pattern at
      the end of the measure.
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="505"
              height="155"
              src="/images/chapters/34-programming-beats-2-linear-drumming/image-5.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      These types of unusual note groupings treat each instrument as equally
      weighted, rather than using the overlaying of multiple voices to emphasize
      particular beat positions. Interestingly, patterns like this tend to be
      perceived very differently at different tempos. At a fast tempo such as
      170 bpm, this pattern takes on a “rolling” character, and the composite
      line—the perceived fusing of the separate parts— becomes much more audible
      in relation to the individual notes. Linear patterns like this are common
      in drum and bass grooves, for example.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s also potentially interesting to add an additional level of
      restriction. You might decide, for example, that your pattern will be
      based entirely on sixteenth notes, and that every sixteenth-note position
      on the grid must contain a note. A complex two-measure version of such a
      pattern might look like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="514"
              height="195"
              src="/images/chapters/34-programming-beats-2-linear-drumming/image-6.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      As with the previous pattern, the linear approach here helps to
      “democratize” the instruments. No one voice has dominance over the others,
      and the traditional roles of timekeeping elements vs. accenting element
      are eliminated. Also, notice that there’s a lot of variation in note
      velocities in this example. Just by changing the volume of certain notes
      in relation to the others, you can make a single pattern of notes take on
      an entirely different character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linear drum patterns aren’t right for every musical context, but they can
      offer a different way of thinking about beat programming that may help you
      come up with new patterns and variations that you might otherwise not have
      considered. And of course, as with all of the suggestions in this book,
      there’s no reason to restrict yourself to strictly following the
      monophonic requirement. If a linear pattern would sound better with some
      instances of multiple simultaneous voices, go ahead and use them.
