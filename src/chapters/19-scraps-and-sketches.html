<h1>Scraps and Sketches</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Your hard drive is filled with unfinished songs, and you know that most of
  them aren’t worth finishing. Whenever you look at these songs, you’re
  frustrated because you feel like you’ve failed and that you have nothing to
  show for all of the work and time you’ve spent on them.

    >We abandon music for a lot of reasons. Sometimes we realize that we’re not
    happy with the direction the song is taking. Sometimes we just get bored, go
    do something else, and then never come back to the work in progress. While
    I’m a strong advocate of finishing bad songs anyway (see Fail Better (page </a
  >291)), the reality is that most producers either have folders full of
  abandoned projects that will never be opened again, or they throw away work in
  progress if it stops being interesting. Here’s an idea for making use of that
  unfinished material.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Rather than considering your folder of unfinished projects as trash or wasted
  effort, consider it as a collection of scraps or sketches, ready for reuse in
  other musical contexts. This way, you can start a new song by extracting
  elements of abandoned or unfinished songs from the past, rather than facing
  the intimidating blank slate of a completely empty project. Forget entirely
  that these were once supposed to
</p>
<p>
  be “songs,” and instead treat them as collections of musical ideas that are
  ready to be used again: your own custom—and completely unique—sound and loop
  library.

    >You may already be keeping a folder of scraps and sketches, either as a
    result of Goal-less Exploration (page </a
  ><a href="#bookmark181" class="a"
    >62) or perhaps by collecting rejected audio files created by Rendering as
    Commitment (page </a
  >283). The only difference here is that you’re rehabilitating
</p>
<p>
  and recycling material that you once intended to be used in an actual, active
  composition. This can be incredibly liberating mentally, because it allows you
  to reject the idea that an unfinished song is a failure and instead embrace it
  as a collection of ammunition for the next song.
</p>
<p>
  So throw away as little as you can. Even if you’re bored after a single
  two-bar drum loop or bass line, save this work into your sketches folder. It’s
  possible that it will become the basis of your next great song.
