    <h1>Programming Beats 3: Ghost Notes</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You’re listening to a lot of acoustic drummers to get ideas for how to
      program more realistic drum parts, and you keep hearing very quiet sounds
      in between what are the clearly important hits. These are barely audible
      but still somehow sound intentional. And most importantly, they seem to
      make the groove work better. What are these sounds, and how can you use
      them in your own music?
    </p>
    <p>
      In a lot of “purely” electronic music, there is often little to no
      variation in dynamics between notes played by a single instrument or even
      between all of the instruments. Each kick drum, clap, snare, etc. is
      generally triggered at the same volume. While this makes sense in many
      genres, it’s quite different from how human drummers play, and if you’re
      interested in making your drum parts sound more human, it may help to
      incorporate a technique drummers call
      <i>ghost notes</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Ghost notes are <i>extremely </i>quiet notes, normally played on the snare
      drum, that help to fill in the space between the prominent notes in the
      pattern. Ghost notes are nearly (but not completely) silent and are
      generally played as quietly as possible (although this varies in practice
      and between genres). For example, here’s a basic one-bar rock drum pattern
      played without ghost notes:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="510"
              height="155"
              src="/images/chapters/35-programming-beats-3-ghost-notes/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The hi-hat provides the regular “timekeeping” function, while the kick and
      snare provide accents that orient the listener to the place within the
      bar. This works fine and might be perfect for many musical situations. But
      in some cases, it might sound better if there’s a bit more activity in
      between the snare backbeats.
    </p>

    <p>A drummer might play the pattern like this:</p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="511"
              height="153"
              src="/images/chapters/35-programming-beats-3-ghost-notes/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The additional low-velocity snare notes on the second and third sixteenths
      of beats one and three help to propel the musical time forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another nice use of ghost notes is for adding very quick gestures that
      lead into or “anticipate” important structural points in the groove, such
      as the downbeat. Here’s an example:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="509"
              height="155"
              src="/images/chapters/35-programming-beats-3-ghost-notes/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The blue notes are the thirty-second notes that drive towards the downbeat
      and might be heard in combination with the downbeat’s kick drum hit as a
      single musical gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#bookmark130" class="a"
        >To exaggerate this effect even more, some drummers will even play these
        thirty-second notes quite a bit behind the beat (see Programming Beats
        1: On Looseness (page </a
      >138)):
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="510"
              height="154"
              src="/images/chapters/35-programming-beats-3-ghost-notes/image-4.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Note that when programming ghost notes in a DAW, the actual musical result
      is entirely dependent on how velocity-sensitive the instrument is that’s
      being triggered. If you’re using a drum machine for example, there may be
      no velocity variation at all, in which case adding ghost notes will simply
      create a different pattern. Ghost notes are usually most effective if
      you’re triggering multisampled acoustic drums, in which there are actually
      low-velocity samples that will respond the way a real drum would respond.
      But of course, these techniques can also work with entirely electronic
      sounds as well. And although drummers usually play their ghost notes on
      the snare, you can also experiment with moving your ghost notes to an
      entirely different instrument.
