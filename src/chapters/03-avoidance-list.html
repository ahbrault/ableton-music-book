<h1>Avoidance List</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Sometimes when we listen back to a recently finished track, we find that it’s
  too similar to something we’ve written before. We’ve managed to develop a
  personal style, but we’re so bound by it that we feel unable to create things
  that really feel new.
</p>
<p>
  We often discover this after listening back to a track a few days after it’s
  finished. While working (or immediately after), we don’t notice the
  similarities. But when we have a bit of distance from the new work, we’re
  suddenly able to hear how it compares to the rest of the music we’ve done, and
  the similarities become painfully obvious. Often, it’s a similarity in
  sound—the same types of samples or synth sounds keep coming up. Sometimes,
  it’s a similarity in form—we rely on the same kinds of transitions or formal
  structures from track to track. It can feel like you’re writing the same music
  over and over again.
</p>
<p>
  Note that, depending on the genre you’re working in, a high degree of
  consistency may be exactly what you’re going for. In commercial styles like
  EDM, for example, predictability of structure and overall sound is a
  fundamental attribute of the style. Radical sound design and unusual forms
  wouldn’t make sense in this music, and the interest comes from seeing how
  effectively artists can work within the strict boundaries that define the
  genre.
</p>
<p>
  But if you’re uncomfortable with the feeling that you’re stuck on repeat,
  here’s a potential solution.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  As soon as you realize that a new track is too similar to something you’ve
  done before, start writing a list of the specific musical attributes that make
  you feel this way. Carefully analyze all of the potential categories—sound,
  harmony, melody, rhythm, and form—and write down the specific technique that’s
  been repeated. This will form an “avoidance list” for your next track, a list
  of things that you’ve decided ahead of time to <i>not </i>do.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re feeling inspired, try to come up with some alternatives to the
  attributes you’ll avoid. This can serve two purposes: First, it gives you
  something to actually do, which will save time when you’re working on the
  track. But more importantly, it might help you identify why you’ve been
  relying on a particular type of technique in the past. For example, if you’ve
  forbidden yourself from using tempo-synced dub delays, you might decide to
  experiment more with reverb. But perhaps the underlying reason for your use of
  delays in the first place is that you’re uncomfortable with the idea of space
  and silence in your music. Maybe this problem can be solved by adding
  additional layers of musical material. Or maybe there isn’t really a problem
  to solve, and your next track could make interesting use of silence that you
  would normally have simply filled in by force of habit.

    >You can think of the avoidance list as a kind of negative version of the
    Catalog of Attributes (page </a
  >16). The goal here is to find patterns in existing music that should be
  avoided, rather than emulated. The difference, of course, is that you’re
  analyzing attributes in your own work rather than that of another artist.
</p>
<p>An avoidance list might look like this:</p>
<ul id="l6">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>stay away from 123-127 bpm; try faster (or maybe slower?)</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>no 808 samples; (try FM drums or processed acoustic samples)</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      no “wood” sounds; (find different percussion elements—white noise or
      metal?)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      no (or less) filter cutoff/resonance sweeps; (try FM for timbral changes)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      no (or less) sidechaining; (write a bass pattern that avoids the kick,
      rather than relying on ducking)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      stop using only two chords; (spend time really working out a more
      comprehensive progression)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      no auto-tuned/chopped vocals (another organic source? non-pitched spoken
      word samples?)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      no drum-less breakdown; (find another way to create formal tension and
      release)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now as you start a new track, you’re forced to find new strategies rather than
  relying on techniques that you already know you’re tired of hearing. You may
  find it difficult to work without these reliable elements of your vocabulary
  in place. But looking for alternatives will help you expand that vocabulary,
  while simultaneously ensuring that this track won’t simply be a clone of the
  last one.

    >~ A note of caution: As with Arbitrary Constraints (page </a
  ><a href="#bookmark112" class="a">33) and Process vs. Product (page </a>85),
  you should feel free to abandon your pre-planned restrictions at any point in
  the writing process. If you find that you’ve eliminated techniques that really
  would sound better in the context of the music you’re working on, you should
  absolutely allow yourself to use them. Restrictions, plans, and structure can
  be important learning tools and can help you to get out of ruts. But in every
  case, the most important thing is the song, and you should do whatever will
  make the best song possible, including deviating from the plan if necessary.
