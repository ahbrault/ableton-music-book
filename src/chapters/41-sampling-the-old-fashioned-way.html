    <h1>Sampling the Old-Fashioned Way</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You hear more and more music that uses samples in ways that sound like a
      deliberate under-leveraging of available technology. With characteristics
      such as “chipmunk vocals” and sampled breakbeats that sound like they’re
      pitched up, a lot of contemporary garage, footwork, and related styles use
      a set of techniques that sound like they’re taking advantage of the
      restrictions of vintage hardware. You’d like to be able to capture some of
      this nostalgic quality in your own music, but you can’t seem to figure out
      how it’s done using modern software tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most important technical developments in sampling technology
      was the advent of <i>time-stretching</i>: adjusting the pitch of a sample
      independently of its tempo (and vice versa). Prior to time- stretching,
      pitch and tempo were inextricably linked; the only way to make a sample
      play at a higher pitch was to play it faster. Modern time-stretching
      technology is great for preserving the realism of retuned samples and
      allows for considerable flexibility in reusing rhythmic samples at a range
      of tempos. But some of the artifacts and quirks in the older approach
      imparted a lot of interesting musical character. Here’s a technique for
      employing old-fashioned approaches to sampling in a creative way.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      In many modern DAWs, time-stretching is enabled by default for clips,
      under the assumption that this is the most flexible choice for most users
      in most musical situations. Although there is always a way to disable this
      functionality, either globally or on a per-clip basis, this usually just
      causes the clips to play back at their original tempo regardless of the
      tempo of the song. To really see what can happen when time-stretching is
      eliminated, try playing the samples from a software or hardware sampler
      instead of placing them along your song’s timeline. Now, samples played at
      different pitches on the keyboard will also play at different tempos. This
      can yield particularly interesting results when working with samples that
      have their own inherent rhythm (such as breakbeats or whole musical
      phrases).
    </p>
    <p>
      The track “Leavin” by DJ Rashad uses this technique to great effect. The
      main hook in the track uses a sample of a two-note pattern: a dotted
      eighth note followed by a sixteenth. The four-bar phrase consists of this
      sample triggered every half note. For the first two bars the sample is at
      its root pitch (E). In bar three, it’s triggered three semitones higher
      (G). In bar four, it’s triggered two semitones below the root (D). In a
      sequencer, the played pattern might look like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="506"
              height="177"
              src="/images/chapters/41-sampling-the-old-fashioned-way/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      But because this is played using old-fashioned sampling technology, the
      transposed pitches play back the sample’s two-note phrase at different
      speeds. What you hear is something closer to this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="512"
              height="180"
              src="/images/chapters/41-sampling-the-old-fashioned-way/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The first two bars play the dotted eighth/sixteenth pattern of the
      original sample. But the pattern in the next bar is transposed higher and
      thus plays faster—closer to the first two notes of a quarter note triplet.
      Finally the samples in the fourth bar play slower—closer to straight
      quarter notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this sample were to have been triggered using a time-stretching
      sampler, there would be no rhythmic variation when transposing. The pitch
      would have changed, but the internal rhythm of the sample would have
      remained at a dotted eighth + sixteenth each time the sample was
      triggered. You’d hear something like this, which is much less interesting:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="514"
              height="180"
              src="/images/chapters/41-sampling-the-old-fashioned-way/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      These examples may be easier to visualize in musical notation (but don’t
      worry if you don’t read music; these are simply notational representations
      of the three patterns shown previously).

    <p>
      By deliberately using an old-fashioned approach to sampling, DJ Rashad
      made use of the limitations in the technology to create a more interesting
      musical result than he could have achieved by using a more modern
      approach.
