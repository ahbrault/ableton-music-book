    <h1>3+3+2 Rhythm</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      There’s a particular off-kilter, asymmetrical, funky rhythm that you keep
      hearing in music of all kinds, from hip-hop to footwork to rock and roll.
      What is it, and how can you use it in your own music?
    </p>
    <p>
      For new producers, there’s a tendency to be overwhelmed by the perception
      that all music is radically unique. The reality, however, is that there is
      a shared vocabulary of underlying musical patterns that artists frequently
      reuse across a variety of genres. Here’s one of the most common.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      The <i>tresillo</i>, or 3+3+2 pattern, is a widely used rhythmic pattern.
      Its origins are unknown, but it’s a staple of African and Latin music and
      was eventually incorporated into early jazz, after which it made its way
      to all of jazz’s descendants: R&amp;B, rock, funk, and eventually modern
      electronic music. In its simplest form, the 3+3+2 pattern looks like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="185"
              src="/images/chapters/32-332-rhythm/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The “3+3+2” refers to the number of sixteenth notes between hits, and the
      pattern repeats every two beats. The pattern can also be played with other
      note durations; a half-time version would be measured in eighth notes, for
      example, and would repeat every four beats.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a stand-alone pattern, 3+3+2 might not be so useful, but it really
      becomes interesting when overlaid against other patterns that are more
      symmetrical. For example, here’s the previous example as a kick drum
      pattern underlying a basic rock groove and expanded to fill a full bar:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="507"
              height="182"
              src="/images/chapters/32-332-rhythm/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      If the backbeats occur at half the speed (on beat 3 rather than beats 2
      and 4), this same pattern begins to resemble a simplified version of the
      drum programming heard in a lot of bass music. With the addition of hi-
      hats on the offbeat eighth notes, the drum part for the track “No Think”
      by Sepalcure is based off this basic pattern:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="513"
              height="185"
              src="/images/chapters/32-332-rhythm/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      As you can see, there is a huge range of possibilities available just by
      combining the standard 3+3+2 rhythm with various other rhythms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, there are a number of ways to subtly vary the basic pattern,
      which can yield even more possibilities.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Skipping or adding one or more notes.
      <span class="p"
        >By leaving out certain notes of the pattern, you can maintain the
        syncopation and asymmetry but in a more subtle way. Conversely, by
        adding notes to the pattern, you can create an embellished version. The
        main drum pattern in Lil Jon’s “Turn Down for What” is an example of
        both processes at work. This is a four- bar phrase in which the kick
        drum pattern consists of three different types of 3+3+2 pattern:</span
      >
    </h4>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="505"
              height="182"
              src="/images/chapters/32-332-rhythm/image-4.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The first and third phrases are identical, with the middle “3” of the
      3+3+2 left unplayed. The second and fourth phrases play the whole pattern,
      but the fourth also adds an additional sixteenth immediately before the
      final “2.” But because the 3+3+2 pattern has already been so strongly
      established, we hear this note purely as an ornament; the underlying 3+3+2
      is still dominant.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Extending the “3.”
      <span class="p"
        >The “2” portion of the 3+3+2 pattern serves to resynchronize the
        gesture with the metric grid. But very interesting things can happen if
        you delay this resynchronization by repeating the “3” parts of the
        gesture additional times. An example of this can be heard in the track
        “Tenderly” by Disclosure. Here, the two-bar kick and clap pattern looks
        like this:</span
      >
    </h4>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="185"
              src="/images/chapters/32-332-rhythm/image-5.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      There are six kick drums in the first bar, which are all three sixteenths
      apart, followed by a pause and then a clear “realignment” with kicks on
      beats two and three in the second bar. This creates a strong contrast
      between rhythmic stability and instability, tension and release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you’re familiar with the 3+3+2 rhythm, you’ll start to notice it
      in various forms in all sorts of different kinds of music. And it’s not
      just useful for drum patterns. You can use 3+3+2 to build bass lines,
      chords, and melodies as well.
