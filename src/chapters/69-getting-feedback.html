<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Finishing</em></p>
<h1>Getting Feedback</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You recognize the value of feedback, but you’re self-conscious about asking
  for other people’s opinions of your music. In addition, you don’t know
  <i>when </i>to ask for it; should you ask people to critique your in- progress
  tracks or only ask when things are finished (when you’ll be more reluctant to
  make changes)? Finally, whom should you ask? Friends and family? Other
  producers? The anonymous internet?
</p>
<p>
  Especially if you’re young or new to making music, it can be difficult to have
  an internal sense of whether or not your work is any good. For new producers
  (and even for veterans), feedback from others can be helpful, but it’s
  important to get feedback at the right time and from
</p>
<p>
  the right people. Here are some tips for how to improve your process of
  collecting feedback.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  If you’re just asking for feedback because you’re seeking praise, then you’re
  not really looking to improve. The most important factor to consider when
  getting feedback on your creative work is whether or not you’re prepared to
  accept criticism. And to be sure that you’ll get criticism, you need to ask
  people who you can be sure will be honest with you. Your mother is likely to
  be a fan of everything you do. But unless she’s also a musician, she may not
  be in a position to give you honest, usable feedback. Getting an ego boost can
  be valuable for your mental health, but beyond that it probably won’t help you
  make better music, so be sure to consider whether or not family and friends
  are a good source of useful feedback or if they’re instead just making you
  feel better.
</p>
<p>
  The best people to give you constructive—and critical—feedback are probably
  going to be other people who are really invested in the kind of music you’re
  trying to make: either other producers or, at least, very serious and
  knowledgeable fans. But even then, you need to consider the relationship
  between you and your critic. A teacher, for example, would probably give very
  different feedback to a student than that
</p>
<p>
  student would give to the teacher. Be careful when asking for feedback from
  people who are your subordinates or who might otherwise have
</p>
<p>
  a reason to stay on your good side. As with friends or relatives, they might
  just be telling you what they think you want to hear.
</p>
<p>
  Getting helpful feedback from the internet can also be a challenge. Websites
  and forums that are made by and for music producers tend to yield feedback
  that is more constructive than sites that allow for truly anonymous comments
  (such as YouTube).
</p>
<p>
  Your most valuable and astute critics, no matter how well intentioned, will
  probably find it difficult to objectively evaluate your music before it’s
  finished. This is because they’ll be evaluating it in comparison to tracks
  that are not only finished but also mastered. We naturally hear music as
  better even if it’s just louder, and it’s difficult to overcome
</p>

<p>
  this biological hardwiring when trying to critique music that’s unfinished.
  One idea might be to have a “quick-and-dirty” mastering preset available that
  can at least get the level of an unfinished track into the general volume
  range of released material. This is, of course, not a substitute for real
  mastering. But if you’re interested in getting feedback on work in progress,
  it will help to allow people to listen to the music without being distracted
  by the low volume.
</p>
<p>
  Also, when asking for feedback, be sure to ask for specifics. Asking someone
  if they like the song will get you a yes or no answer, which isn’t really of
  much use. But asking for details—about sounds, form, and other fine
  details—will likely yield much more useful feedback about your musical
  decisions.
</p>
<p>
  Remember that once you’ve released something into the world— whether on a
  label or just on your own via the internet—you’ll get criticism no matter
  what. You may find it beneficial to hear some of this feedback ahead of time
  by asking for it early. Just make sure you do it at the right time and from
  the right people.
