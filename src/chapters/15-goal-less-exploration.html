<h1>Goal-less Exploration</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re sitting in front of your DAW, but you’re uninspired. You’ve opened the
  DAW out of habit, or because you know you should, or because you have the
  abstract feeling of wanting to make music, but you have no real sense that you
  actually want to make anything in particular. This feels frustrating, and like
  wasted time. Maybe you should just close the DAW and try again another day.
</p>
<p>
  Many of us are happy once a song is finished, but often we find the process of
  actually making the song to be painful, boring, or unrewarding. Sometimes we
  might reach a point where we see that the end of the song is in sight, and
  then we’re inspired by the prospect of having something to show for our work.
  But until that point, it really does feel like work. How can you generate
  inspiration? Just opening a new project sometimes isn’t enough.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  If you’ve already taken the step to open your DAW, you should congratulate
  yourself; this is farther than many musicians got today. Our computers (and
  even the real world) offer endless distractions that can prevent us from even
  beginning work. And although our underlying goal is to get music made,
  sometimes this is too much of a responsibility to bear. Even though you don’t
  feel like working, once the DAW is open, there are a number of things you can
  do to seize the moment, even if it’s a brief one.
</p>
<p>
  Goal-less exploration is the process of simply finding a corner of your
  working space and letting yourself see what evolves from there. For example,
  maybe there’s a particular instrument or effect in your DAW that you’ve never
  taken the time to learn or that you’ve tried to use but never could find a
  place for in your music. Since the DAW is open anyway, try loading these
  devices and just experimenting with them. Without the pressure of trying to
  use them to make music, just spend some time learning what sorts of sounds
  they can make.
</p>
<p>
  Another type of goal-less exploration can come from taking some time and going
  through your loop and sample library. If you’re like most producers, you’ve
  probably collected far more samples than you’ve ever had time to really listen
  to. If you don’t feel like working on music, explore those folders of samples
  and see what you actually have.
</p>
<p>
  Working in this kind of free, non-directed way can sometimes unlock creative
  directions that you never would have found in your normal working process,
  when you might be tempted to use templates or known tools in order to get
  going more quickly. If goal-less exploration actually manages to turn into
  real, finished work, then all the better.
</p>
<p>
  But you’re also not under any obligation to turn your explorations into a
  finished song, or even the beginning of one. Maybe you’ll work for a long time
  and find that you’ve created nothing worth saving. This is
</p>
<p>
  OK. The point here is that you’re doing something that is at least in the
  realm of music-making; this is already closer to where you want to be than,
  for example, Facebook.
</p>

<p>
  There are so many things you can do in a DAW that aren’t directly focused on
  the creation and completion of a song. If your DAW is open, but your normal
  creative inspiration isn’t there, try simply exploring and see where it leads.
