    <h1>Misusing Rhythmic Tools</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You have a variety of tools in your DAW arsenal—such as quantization,
      slicing, and beat-juggling effects—that are designed to help you work with
      rhythmic material. But you feel like there’s more potential in these tools
      that you haven’t yet discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some workflows and effects are clearly designed for use with very specific
      types of material. But there’s no reason why you can’t repurpose them for
      other uses. Here are some ideas for how to creatively misuse rhythmic
      tools to achieve unexpected results.
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions:</h2>

    <p class="s7">Misusing Quantization</p>
    <p>
      Quantization is typically used to correct timing errors in manually played
      MIDI material and, in some DAWs, audio samples. But there are a number of
      ways to use quantization “incorrectly,” sometimes with surprising results.
    </p>
    <p>
      One interesting experiment: Try quantizing to a note value that is
      substantially slower or faster than the source material. If you played
      sixteenth notes, for example, try quantizing to a slower note value like
      quarter notes. If you originally played a monophonic figure, you’ll end up
      generating chords. You can even apply successively larger quantization
      values to already quantized material to achieve the same effect. Here’s a
      figure played in sixteenth notes:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="95"
              src="/images/chapters/31-misusing-rhythmic-tools/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>And here’s the same material after quantizing to quarter notes:</p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="514"
              height="94"
              src="/images/chapters/31-misusing-rhythmic-tools/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Another way to generate unexpected results from quantization is to start
      by playing your parts at a dramatically faster tempo than you actually
      intend. Because the errors in your playing will likely be more extreme
      than usual, applying quantization will then “correct” the note placements
      to unusual positions. When you then slow the tempo down to a more
      musically appropriate one, you may have created patterns that you never
      would have played intentionally.
    </p>

    <p class="s7">Misusing Slicing</p>
    <p>
      Slicing is typically used to separate rhythmic events (such as drum hits)
      from audio material such as drum beats or bass lines. But there’s no
      reason why you can’t slice any audio material, including entirely ambient
      pads, field recordings, or other non-rhythmic samples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another idea: If your DAW allows you to create or move markers in the
      original audio to determine the positions at which slices will be created,
      try placing the markers in deliberately “wrong” places.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many DAWs, slicing generates a new instrument—and potentially a new
      effects chain—for each slice. This makes it easy to apply dramatically
      different types of processing to individual slices, regardless of their
      source. For this reason, slicing can often lead to interesting results
      even when you’re slicing things in the “wrong” ways.
    </p>

    <p class="s7">Misusing Beat-Juggling Effects</p>
    <p>
      Effects that chop and rearrange incoming audio material in real time are
      normally used for creating variations of beats. But, as with the slicing
      examples discussed previously, you can also create interesting results by
      feeding these effects with any other material, including things that have
      no clear rhythm at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although these are some examples for how to misuse specific workflows,
      consider applying this approach to all of your tools. Any effect,
      instrument, or workflow can potentially yield interesting results when
      used in unusual ways. Learn what your tools are supposed to do, but don’t
      be afraid to make them do something else.
