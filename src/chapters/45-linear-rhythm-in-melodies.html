    <h1>Linear Rhythm in Melodies</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You can come up with the beginnings of a good melody, but you’re looking
      for ways to generate more variations and complexity. In general, your
      melodic ideas don’t have the depth or richness of those you admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melodies are hard. Almost by definition, they are the most important and
      memorable aspect of a good piece of music. But coming up with one that’s
      worth remembering feels almost as challenging as writing the entire rest
      of the song. Here is a technique you can try for generating more interest
      in your melodic writing.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p class="s12">
      Hocket
      <a href="#bookmark132" class="a"
        >is a compositional technique in which the notes of a melodic line
        quickly alternate between two or more different instruments, such that
        no two instruments are playing at the same time. It is the melodic
        equivalent of linear drumming (see Programming Beats 2: Linear Drumming
        (page </a
      ><span class="p"
        >144)) and can potentially turn bland melodies into interesting
        counterpoint. Hocket usually works best at fast tempos and when played
        by instruments with fast attacks and releases. It’s a</span
      >
      difficult technique for humans to play accurately but works really well
      for electronic music. As an example, let’s begin with the simple loop
      below:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="505"
              height="192"
              src="/images/chapters/45-linear-rhythm-in-melodies/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      An easy recipe for turning this single voice into a hocketing pattern is
      as follows:
    </p>
    <ol id="l29">
      <li data-list-text="1.">
        <p>
          Duplicate the track, so that you have two identical copies of the
          pattern playing two separate (but so far, identical) instruments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="2.">
        <p>
          Modify the instrument in the new track so that it plays a different
          sound. This can be done by modifying or replacing the preset or even
          by replacing the instrument with a different one. As mentioned
          previously, try to find two instruments with similar volume contours.
          Short sounds with fast attacks work best.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="3.">
        <p>
          Edit both patterns so that the melody is divided between them, such
          that no note is ever played by both instruments simultaneously.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The way in which you divide the notes is entirely up to you, but really
      interesting hockets tend to alternate very quickly between the voices. The
      simplest example is probably literal alternation— the instruments trade
      off every other note. Here’s how our original pattern might look if it was
      divided in this way:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="511"
              height="208"
              src="/images/chapters/45-linear-rhythm-in-melodies/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      You could also alternate by larger note groupings, such as every quarter
      note:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="506"
              height="211"
              src="/images/chapters/45-linear-rhythm-in-melodies/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Or you could alternate by arbitrary time groupings, such as every third
      sixteenth (including rests):
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="507"
              height="211"
              src="/images/chapters/45-linear-rhythm-in-melodies/image-4.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Notice that in the last example, the pattern doesn’t divide evenly into
      groups of three sixteenths, so the final alternation is cut short in the
      bottom voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      These examples illustrate some possibilities with a two-voice hocket, but
      even more possibilities become available when you use three or more
      voices. In an extreme example, each note could be played by a separate
      instrument. Hocket can give even the simplest melody a whole new life by
      subjecting it to a rapidly changing cascade of new timbres.
