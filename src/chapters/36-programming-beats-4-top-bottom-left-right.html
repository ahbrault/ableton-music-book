    <h1>Programming Beats 4: Top, Bottom, Left, Right</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      From listening to a lot of music, you have a general understanding of how
      to program beats that sound similar to those in the music that inspires
      you. But you don’t really have a sense of how the various drums in a drum
      kit relate to each other or the way human drummers think when they sit
      down at the drums and play. As a result, you’re concerned that your
      programmed beats are either too mechanical sounding or are simply the
      result of your own interpretation and guesswork about what you hear in
      other music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you have no intention of writing “human”-sounding drum parts, it
      can be helpful to understand some of the physical implications of playing
      a real drum kit. Here are some ways that drummers approach their
      instrument.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      At a philosophical level, a drum kit can be thought of as divided into top
      and bottom halves. The top half includes all of the cymbals: the hi-hat,
      ride, crashes, and possibly more esoteric cymbals like splashes, Chinese
      cymbals, gongs, etc. These are the “top” half for two reasons:
    </p>
    <p>
      They’re both physically higher than the drums, and they also occupy a
      higher range in the frequency spectrum. In contrast, the bottom half is
      the drums themselves: the kick, snare, and toms. (The snare is a special
      case and can be thought of as somewhere in between the top and the bottom
      in frequency. But for our purposes, let’s consider it part of the bottom
      group).
    </p>
    <p>
      Drummers tend to unconsciously approach beat making from either the “top
      down” or the “bottom up,” depending primarily on genre. Jazz drumming
      beats, for example, are generally built from the top down, with the ride
      cymbal pattern being the most important element, followed by the hi-hat
      (played by the foot). In this context, the kick and snare drum serve to
      accent or interrupt the pattern which is established by the cymbals. A
      typical jazz drumming pattern might look like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="512"
              height="113"
              src="/images/chapters/36-programming-beats-4-top-bottom-left-right/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      In contrast, rock, pop, or R&amp;B drumming beats are built from the
      bottom up, with the interplay between the kick and the snare comprising
      the most important layer and the hi-hat or ride cymbal patterns serving as
      a secondary element. A typical rock drumming pattern might look like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="513"
              height="113"
              src="/images/chapters/36-programming-beats-4-top-bottom-left-right/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Note that in both jazz and rock beats, the cymbals generally play simple,
      repeating patterns, while the kick and snare play gestures that are more
      asymmetrical. But in jazz, those simple cymbal patterns are fundamental
      signifiers of the genre. In rock, the cymbal patterns are secondary in
      importance, while the asymmetrical kick and snare gestures are what define
      the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      An awareness of these drumming concepts might give you some things to
      think about when writing your own electronic drum parts. Are you thinking
      from the top (cymbals) down, or from the bottom (kick and snare) up? Is
      the genre you’re working in defined by repeating patterns (such as the
      steady four-on-the-floor kick drum of house and techno) or by asymmetrical
      gestures (such as the snare rolls used for buildups in trance)?
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the top/bottom dichotomy, drummers also must make decisions
      along the left/right axis when determining how a particular pattern is
      divided between the left and right hands. On a drum kit, some of this is
      determined by the physical location of the instruments.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for an instrument like a hi-hat that can be reached by either hand,
      there is often a subtle difference in sound depending on how the pattern
      is played. For example, consider the following beat:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="512"
              height="113"
              src="/images/chapters/36-programming-beats-4-top-bottom-left-right/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      At slow-to-moderate tempos, most drummers would probably play the hi-hat
      part with one hand, leaving the other free for the snare drum. But once
      the tempo becomes too fast, it’s no longer possible to play a continuous
      stream of sixteenth notes with one hand. At this point, many drummers
      would switch to playing the hi-hat with alternating sticking, each stroke
      with the opposite hand. But this requires some compromises: Beats two and
      four require both hands to be playing together, so the player must either
      move one hand very quickly between the snare and hi-hat or play at least
      two consecutive hi-hat notes with the same hand. In both cases, there will
      likely be a slightly different resulting sound. Even the subtle physical
      differences between two drumsticks can result in a different sound versus
      when a pattern is played with a single hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, none of these physical restrictions apply to the electronic
      domain by default. There’s no inherent physical speed limit and no need
      for any notion of “alternating stickings.” At any tempo, consecutive notes
      can sound completely identical if that’s your intent. But if you’d like to
      apply some of the sonic characteristics that come about as a result of
      these human restrictions, you can do so manually. For example, you could
      try creating a very small change in velocity for every other note in a
      repeating pattern. Or with a bit more work, you could actually use a
      slightly different sound for every other note. Some software samplers have
      a feature called “round robin” that automatically plays a different sample
      with each key press.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking like a drummer can be a useful exercise when writing beats for
      any genre—even ones that have no overt relationship to acoustic music at
      all.
