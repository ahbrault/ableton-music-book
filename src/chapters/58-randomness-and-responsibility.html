<h1>Randomness and Responsibility</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You have some “randomization” plug-ins that promise to create a never-ending
  supply of new ideas without much effort. In principle, you’re excited by the
  potential of making lots of music with little work. But in practice, the
  results you’re getting are unsatisfying for some reason.
</p>
<p>
  There are some types of music, like classic IDM, breakcore, etc., in which
  constant change is a defining characteristic of the sound. Particularly with
  drum programming, music in these genres can be extremely time-consuming to
  build by hand, requiring lots of deliberately placed samples, micro-edits to
  parameter automation, etc. For this reason, there are a number of plug-ins and
  other tools available that process an incoming stream of audio and reorder it
  rhythmically on the fly (these often have the word “buffer” in their names or
  descriptions), apply effects to only specific time slices of the audio, or
  perform some combination of both processes.
</p>
<p>
  On the other end of the musical spectrum are genres like minimal or dub
  techno, in which the overall rate of sonic and musical change is much slower.
  But even here, there are times when applying subtle randomness to some aspect
  of the music can kick you out of your normal patterns of production and help
  you find ideas that you wouldn’t have found through your own deliberate
  action.
</p>

<p>
  And when working in any genre, there may be times when you know you want
  something to change, but you don’t care about the specific aspects of how it
  changes. For example, you may want the panning of a particular element to vary
  continuously throughout the track, but drawing in a detailed automation curve
  may be too time-consuming. In this case, applying some kind of randomizer to
  the panning may give you what you want—a continuous state of change, without
  the need to specify the details.
</p>
<p>But sometimes the results just don’t work. Here’s a solution.</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Randomization tools can be powerful, but they lack the most important element
  that makes your music work—your own taste. When you’re in control of every
  element, you’re making conscious micro- and macro-level decisions about each
  moment of the music. If you play a wrong note (or the right note at the wrong
  time), you hear it immediately and fix it. But when a tool has generated this
  wrong note for you, it’s easy to miss.
</p>
<p>
  To go back to the early IDM example, consider classic tracks by artists like
  Squarepusher and Aphex Twin. During this era, there were no plug-ins that
  would accomplish the micro-editing that’s happening in this music. What you’re
  hearing is a process that was done moment by moment, by hand.
</p>
<p>
  This is not to suggest that randomization tools are “cheating” or should be
  avoided. There’s nothing inherently wrong with finding ways to eliminate
  unnecessary work. But it’s important to keep yourself fully invested in the
  process. Although the secrets behind what happens in your studio are yours, in
  the end, your name will be on this music. Even if it’s made entirely by a
  machine via some sort of algorithmic composition process, it is still your job
  to evaluate the results that are generated, discard the ones that don’t work,
  and keep the ones that do. The less you’re involved in the creative minutiae,
  the more you need to be involved in actively auditioning the results.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of specific technical steps, try slowing things down, soloing them,
  or bouncing the results to audio so that you can really assess whether the
  randomized output has the musical effect you want. If you’re working with
  randomizers that generate or alter MIDI data, try re-recording this output to
  another MIDI track so that you can capture the randomized material as “real”
  MIDI data, which you can then edit later. One nice way to test the limits of
  your randomization processes is to increase the amount of randomization until
  it’s clearly too extreme, and then dial it back from there. The “right” amount
  is totally subjective and depends on the genre you’re working in and, most
  importantly, your personal taste.
</p>
<p>
  As always, you must be willing to throw material away if it doesn’t sound
  right. Listen to—and take responsibility for—every moment.
