<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Progressing</em></p>
<h1>Tuning Everything</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re happy with all of the parts of your song, and the arrangement feels
  right.
  You’re happy with all of the sounds as well— but only when you listen to them
  in isolation. When you listen to everything together,
  the energy and power that you hear in the individual parts seems to get
  blurred or lost. You’ve done all of the EQing and production tricks to make
  space for the various parts in the mix, but it still isn’t working.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes there are musical factors, rather than production ones, that greatly
  affect whether or not a mix “gels” into a single, cohesive sound. One of the
  most important—and most overlooked—musical considerations is tuning. Here are
  some tips for ensuring that all of the elements in your mix are in tune with
  each other.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Producers are generally pretty careful about making sure that the overtly
  pitched elements in their tracks are in tune with each other. Except in some
  experimental genres where unusual tuning
</p>
<p>
  relationships are a fundamental part of the musical concept, things like bass
  lines, harmony parts, and melodic elements sound terrible when their tunings
  don’t match. But producers are often less careful when
</p>
<p>
  it comes to tuning elements like drums, which typically have a less definite
  pitch. In genres that use acoustic drums, this isn’t usually an issue;
  acoustic drums are generally heard as unpitched. (The exception is toms, which
  often are tuned both to each other and to the key of
</p>
<p>
  the song.) But in electronic music, drum sounds are often generated via
  synthesis; kick drums are often made from pure sine waves, for example. And in
  these cases, drums may actually have a clearly audible pitch that should
  usually be tuned to the other instruments in the song.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned earlier, electronic kick drums are the most obvious candidates
  for tuning, especially if they’re made from sustained sine waves. And as with
  acoustic toms, electronic toms are also often clearly pitched. If you’re using
  toms in your song, you probably don’t want them all at the same pitch, so it
  might make sense to tune them in intervals that spell out the song’s root
  chord. For example, a song in C minor might work well with the kick tuned to a
  C and toms tuned to an E<span class="s18">b </span>and a G.
</p>
<p>
  But even other percussion sounds with less obvious pitches can often still be
  tuned. Wooden and metallic sounds, such as sampled or synthesized woodblocks
  and cowbells, often have a clear pitch. And even cymbals, snares, claps, and
  other “noisy” sounds can sometimes
</p>
<p>
  be tunable. You may not hear a pitch when listening to these sounds for the
  first time, but over the course of a whole song, certain frequencies within
  almost any sound will start to come to the forefront and will likely be
  perceived as the pitch of that sound.
</p>

<p>
  In situations where you’re working with noisy sounds, the pitch may be hard to
  identify, but you may still hear that it’s wrong. A spectrum analyzer, in
  conjunction with an EQ, can be really helpful in these cases. You can use the
  spectrum analyzer to find the frequencies that are louder than the average
  noise level, and then use EQ to either emphasize those frequencies (if they
  happen to be in tune) or
</p>
<p>
  attenuate them (if they’re out of tune with respect to the harmonic and
  melodic parts).
</p>
<p>
  If you’ve committed to tuning your drums to the key of your song, but you’re
  writing a song that changes keys part way through, you’ll need to make
  decisions about whether to retune the drums as well. In some cases, simply
  retuning the kick and toms might be enough. But you’ll need to carefully
  listen and think about how the drums work in relation to the other parts after
  the key change and adjust as necessary. In many cases, it may sound odd for
  the drums to suddenly be repitched. Ideally, drum tuning shouldn’t be
  noticeable to most listeners; drums that are in tune with the other
  instruments shouldn’t sound pitched. Instead, they should just make the whole
  song feel more like a single, cohesive entity.
