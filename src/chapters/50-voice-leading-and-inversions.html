    <h1>Voice Leading and Inversions</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      When you play chords on your keyboard, you find that the motion from one
      chord to the next sounds choppy or abrupt. Furthermore, you feel like you
      have to move your hands really far to get from one chord to another. But
      in the music that inspires you, the chords always sound like they move
      smoothly from one to another. What are your favorite artists doing that
      makes such a difference?
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating smooth, flowing chord progressions often has less to do with what
      the actual chords are than it does with the nature of the
      <i>voice leading </i>from one chord to the next. Here’s some information
      about how voice leading works and how to use it to create more satisfying
      harmony in your own music.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Although we normally think of a chord as a vertical construction, we can
      think of the motion between chords as a series of horizontal
      constructions. That is, when one chord moves to another, the individual
      voices within those chords can be thought of as separate melodic lines.
      This relationship between the separate voices when moving between chords
      is known as voice leading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although voice leading is a big topic, we can use just a few basic voice
      leading principles to help create smoother, better-sounding chord
      progressions. In general, smooth voice leading results from
      <i
        >minimizing the amount of motion from one note to the next within a
        single voice.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      This means moving the smallest possible number of semitones, as well as
      preserving <i>common tones </i>whenever possible. (Common tones are notes
      that remain unchanged from one chord to the next.)
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, let’s imagine a two-chord progression that moves from a C
      minor chord to an F minor chord. The simplest way to construct such a
      progression is probably something like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="157"
              src="/images/chapters/50-voice-leading-and-inversions/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Both of these chords are in what’s known as <i>root position</i>: The
      “roots” of the chords (C and F) are the lowest voices of the chords. For
      non- keyboard players root position chords are usually where the hands
      fall naturally. But progressions from one root position chord to another
      result in voice leading that’s not ideal. In this example, no common tones
      are retained, and each voice needs to move a considerable distance (as
      shown by the black lines).
    </p>
    <p>A smoother version of this progression might be something like this:</p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="155"
              src="/images/chapters/50-voice-leading-and-inversions/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Here, the C minor chord is still in root position, but we’ve changed the
      order of the notes in the F minor chord to improve the voice leading. A
      reordering of a chord’s notes is known as an <i>inversion</i>. In this
      case, we’ve inverted the F minor chord by placing the C (rather than the
      F) in the bass. This means that we maintain a common tone (the C) when
      moving between the chords while also decreasing the distance traveled by
      the upper voices.
    </p>

    <p>
      We could achieve a similar effect by inverting the first chord while
      leaving the second one in root position:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="156"
              src="/images/chapters/50-voice-leading-and-inversions/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Here, we’ve inverted the C minor chord by placing the E<span class="s18"
        >b </span
      >(rather than the C) in the bass. This means we maintain a common tone
      (the C) when moving between the chords, while again minimizing the
      distance that the other two voices travel.

        >By carefully using chord inversions, you can create smooth voice
        leading from one chord to the next, which is both easier to play and
        (generally) sounds better. But note that there are certain cases (as
        discussed in the chapter on Parallel Harmony (page </a
      >229)), when you might not want to change the voicing of chords but
      instead move in parallel from one chord to another. The choice depends on
      genre and personal taste.
