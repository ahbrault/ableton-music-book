    <h1>Fuzzy Boundaries</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      DAWs tend to automatically structure material in blocks (often called
      “clips” or “regions”) with clearly defined beginnings and endings. Musical
      structure is then created by moving the blocks around in time, but the
      sharp edges between the blocks also create a specific type of musical
      abruptness which may sound stiff, formulaic, and unrefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most pieces of music divide time into sections, where each section
      contains a particular type of musical material that contrasts with that in
      the other sections. Additionally, these sections often exist within a
      hierarchy of sectional layers, with smaller contrasting subsections
      chained together to form the larger sections. In the abstract, this
      hierarchy might look something like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      DAWs represent this musical structure in a very clear way; blocks of time
      appear as literal blocks on the screen. But the boundaries of these blocks
      suggest boundaries in time that are not always good representations of the
      musical results we want. Here are some ways to make the boundaries between
      formal sections less abrupt.
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions:</h2>

    <p>
      Abrupt formal boundaries look like a straight vertical line that cuts
      through the material in your tracks from top to bottom:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="/images/chapters/26.1-fuzzy-bounderies/image-4.webp" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The most straightforward way to deal with this kind of abruptness is to
      simply make that line become jagged or disappear entirely by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          extending material from the previous section in one or more (but not
          all) tracks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          retracting material from the previous section in one or more (but not
          all) tracks.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          deleting material on either side of the formal boundary in one or more
          tracks.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For example, here’s how this formal division might look after applying all
      of these techniques:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="/images/chapters/26.1-fuzzy-bounderies/image-5.webp" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      In this example, only the bottom two tracks have been left as they were in
      the original version. The top two tracks have had material extended beyond
      the formal boundary, while the next two tracks transition early. The
      following five tracks all use silence to blur the transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      ~ Note that this example is not a prescription for a particular set of
      actions; there’s nothing inherent about this particular pattern of changes
      that will make sense in all cases. Of course, it’s necessary to adapt what
      you do to the specifics of the material in your song.
    </p>
    <p>
      These kinds of “coarse-grained” changes to the length and position of
      clips can be effective. But sometimes you’ll want to edit the material
      within the clips themselves. Here are some “fine-grained” ways to think
      about working with this material:
    </p>
    <h4>
      Anticipation
      <span class="p"
        >- Drum fills are a common technique used to create a sense of
        transition from one section to another. But it’s common to hear drum
        fills that lead out of one section and then end precisely on the
        downbeat of the next section. Here’s an example of a “typical” drum fill
        that ends exactly on a downbeat. The energy peaks at the downbeat of bar
        3:</span
      >
    </h4>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="/images/chapters/26.1-fuzzy-bounderies/image-6.webp" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      This is often musically effective, but it can sometimes feel formulaic and
      abrupt. Instead, try writing drum fills that <i>anticipate</i>, or end
      slightly earlier than expected. Reaching the peak of a fill slightly
      before the downbeat, for example, can create an interesting shift in the
      flow of musical time. This can be particularly effective if the actual
      downbeat is de-emphasized somehow, perhaps by stopping the drums entirely
      until the second beat of the next section, and then re-entering with a
      “crash” or some other moment that emphasizes the sense of a musical
      ending. Here’s an example of a drum fill that anticipates the sectional
      boundary. The energy peaks before the downbeat, followed by silence and a
      re-entrance on beat 2:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="/images/chapters/26.1-fuzzy-bounderies/image-7.webp" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>
      Hesitation
      <span class="p"
        >- Conversely, try writing a drum fill that lasts longer than expected,
        extending over the formal boundary between the sections and ending after
        the rest of the musical material has already changed to the new section.
        In these cases, it often works well if there’s no sharp emphasis on the
        end of the fill, and instead the drums of the new section simply take
        over as seamlessly as possible after the fill. Here’s an example of a
        drum fill that hesitates beyond the sectional boundary. The energy
        continues through the downbeat and peaks on beat 2:</span
      >
    </h4>

    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img src="/images/chapters/26.1-fuzzy-bounderies/image-8.webp" />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Note that you can also apply anticipation and hesitation processes to
      musical elements besides drums. Try embellishing bass lines using these
      techniques, or extending (or shortening) sustained chords.
