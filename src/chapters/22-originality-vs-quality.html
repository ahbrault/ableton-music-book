<h1>Originality vs. Quality</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re happy with the music you make, and other people are as well. But deep
  down, you don’t believe it’s truly original, and you feel that you should be
  working harder to find a sound that is uniquely your own.
</p>
<p>
  Particularly among music critics, journalists, and bloggers, originality is
  regularly cited as a necessary component of good music. Pejorative terms like
  “derivative” or “formulaic” are often used to deride music that sounds like
  something else. But what critics write is not always what listeners hear, and
  there may be different ways of weighing musical value.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  What does originality actually mean in a musical context? As a descriptor, all
  it tells you is that something sounds unique, or that its influences are not
  obvious. But what the word doesn’t convey is any information about quality,
  which is a far more valuable characteristic. “Original” and “good” are not
  mutually exclusive, but they are also not correlated. There is plenty of
  terrible music that sounds like nothing else, and in many cases the very
  characteristics that make it original are also what make it bad. Consider that
  what one artist thinks is original may simply be something that other artists
  have already tried and discarded.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of aiming for an abstract goal like originality, aim instead for the
  concrete goal of <i>quality</i>. This is not to suggest that you should
  actively try to make your music sound like something else, but rather that you
  should try to find and strengthen your own voice through a process of
  constant, varied listening, experimentation, synthesis of disparate
  influences, and—above all—hard work. If you only listen to a small variety of
  music, there are really only two conceivable outcomes for your own creations:
  Either you’ll make things that reflect your limited exposure or you’ll make
  things that you believe are original but are more than likely simply outside
  of your experience.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you really only want to make music within a particular, narrow genre,
  you should <i>still </i>aim for a wide range of listening experiences. For
  example, imagine you only want to make old-school house tracks. Since a
  characteristic of that style is sampled phrases from jazz, soul, and R&amp;B
  records, wouldn’t an understanding of those genres be a valuable tool in your
  creative arsenal? Wouldn’t understanding how jazz drummers and bass players
  approach rhythm and harmony help your own rhythm and harmony? And if you end
  up making old-school house music that fits perfectly into the confines of the
  genre, no one can claim that you’re original. But if the music is good, that’s
  all that matters.
</p>

<p>
  In the end, the music that’s remembered is not necessarily the music that’s
  the most radically avant-garde. Instead, it’s the music that’s good. If you
  can achieve both quality and originality, then you’re a rarity. But the
  primary goal should always be quality first.
