<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  The closer you get to finishing the track, the more you realize that it’s a
  failure. It will be impossible to turn this into something you’ll be proud of.
  Why bother finishing it
  at all? Wouldn’t it make more sense to just abandon it and start over on a
  completely different project?
</p>
<p>
  It’s depressing to realize that you’ve made something bad. It’s even more
  depressing to realize it while you’re still working on it but after it’s
  beyond any hope of salvation. But in this situation, there are still valid
  reasons to keep going and finish the track anyway.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Most producers have started far more tracks than they’ve finished. It’s much
  easier to give up in the middle of a project and move on to something new than
  it is to see a project through to the very end.
</p>
<p>
  But what most producers don’t realize is that each stage of the music- making
  process is itself a thing that requires practice. We get to be better sound
  designers by designing sounds. We get to be better drum programmers by
  programming drums. And we get to be better song finishers by
  <i>finishing songs</i>. Because of this, the more songs we start but don’t
  finish, the more opportunities we miss out on to practice finishing. And as a
  result, we might continually improve at various aspects of the early stages,
  but we’ll never improve at actually getting things done.
</p>
<p>
  If you realize very early that what you’re working on isn’t going to be
  successful, you probably have time to change directions and make things
  better. But if you’re very late in the process of making the track before
  realizing that it’s not good, it might be too late to fix it without
  completely gutting it (which is essentially the same as starting over). In
  these cases, forcing yourself to finish—no matter how painful—is often better
  than giving up. You’ll not only get practice finishing, but you’ll also get
  practice failing, in itself a valuable skill to learn in a subjective and
  unpredictable business like art. The better you get at finishing, and the
  better you get at coping with failure, the better your chances will be the
  next time you begin (and, hopefully, finish) a project.
</p>
<p>
  If the track is really as bad as you think, maybe there is a natural end point
  that’s earlier than where you’d stop with a track you were happy with. For
  example, it might not make sense to get your new track professionally
  mastered. And it might be a good idea to not
</p>
<p>
  <a href="#bookmark107" class="a">share it with the public. Maybe it just goes right back into your Scraps
    and Sketches (page </a>74) folder, to be pulled apart for use in other tracks later. But the
  important thing is that you actually finish the arrangement, if for no other
  reason than to practice, improve, and experience how it feels to finish.
