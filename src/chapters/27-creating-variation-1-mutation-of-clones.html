<h1>Creating Variation 1: Mutation of Clones</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’ve come up with a great-sounding seed of a musical idea. But now that you
  have it, you find that you don’t know how to proceed. Maybe it’s a few notes
  or a few bars, but it’s definitely not long enough to be a finished piece. You
  keep listening to the promising idea over and over again, unable to see a
  direction that will get you from here to a song.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of methods for generating many new ideas from the seed of
  one simple idea. Here is one recipe.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Duplicate the initial idea a number of times (maybe eight or so) so that you
  have a number of identical copies. Edit the first duplicate until you have
  made only one meaningful change. You’ll ultimately need to use your own taste
  and intuition to determine what “meaningful” means in the context of this
  particular idea, but the broad categories to consider are the fundamental
  parameters of music:
</p>
<ul id="l20">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Sound: changes to the timbre</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Harmony: changes to the chords</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Melody: changes to the foreground line</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Rhythm: changes to the timing of events</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Form: changes to the structure or distribution of smaller-scale components
      within the idea
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  You’ve succeeded when you can listen to the original and the edited duplicate
  back-to-back and clearly hear (or at least feel) that they’re somehow
  different.
</p>
<p>
  After making your one meaningful change to the first duplicate, move to the
  second duplicate and again make one meaningful change. The change could be of
  the same type as the change you made to the previous edit or it could be a
  change of an entirely different musical parameter. Again, all that matters is
  that it is audibly different from the original (and, in this case, also
  audibly different from the previously edited version).
</p>
<p>
  Repeat this process until you’ve made one meaningful change to each of the
  copies.
</p>
<p>
  What you have now is a collection of “siblings,” each of which is a direct
  descendant of the “parent” idea. Because you’ve made only one meaningful
  change to each duplicate, the relationship to the original will be clear.
</p>
