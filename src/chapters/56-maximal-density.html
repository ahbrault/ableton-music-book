<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Progressing</em></p>
<h1>Maximal Density</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’ve completely finished the first section of a song but don’t know how to
  go on from here. Considering how much time and effort you spent on the first
  part, adding a second section feels like creating an entirely new project. And
  since you know that there are many sections to go, the end of the song feels
  like it’s an impossible distance away.
</p>
<p>
  Moving forward with a track that’s in progress can sometimes feel like an
  impossible task, especially if you’re starting from the beginning and working
  your way from left to right towards the end. Here’s a method for approaching
  the process “out of order” that may sometimes allow you to work faster.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Instead of proceeding linearly from left to right in time, try starting with
  an arbitrary section in the middle of the song that is <i>maximally dense</i>;
  that is, a section in which every possible element that could ever happen
  simultaneously is actually happening simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
  This song section may be purely hypothetical; by stacking every part on top of
  every other part you may end up with an unmusical mess which will never
  actually become a part of the song. If that’s the case, begin subtracting
  elements one by one until you get to a level of density that is still high but
  which makes musical sense. This can then become the high point of your song.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have this peak section, you can make duplicates of it and then try
  out various lower-density versions of the same basic material by muting or
  deleting various elements or tracks and auditioning the result. Each time you
  find a combination that you like, copy and paste it so that it becomes a new
  song section. The act of arranging, then, is just a matter of organizing these
  sections of varying density in an order that makes sense with the ebb and flow
  that you want for the song.

    >Beginning with a section of maximal density is similar to Arranging as a
    Subtractive Process (page </a
  >259) but is focused on the compositional stage rather than on the arranging
  stage. Although both ideas require that you have a pool of materials to work
  with, Maximal Density doesn’t require you to lay them out into a song-length
  arrangement, but rather to stack the ideas vertically so that they comprise a
  single, dense section. From here, you can build your arrangement by creating
  variations that are texturally-reduced versions of the “master” section.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this idea may only work in this very literal way if you’re working
  in a genre such as minimal techno, in which there is not necessarily the
  expectation that the various song sections will be radically different from
  one another. In other genres in which there might be more contrast from one
  section to another, you may be able to take the idea of Maximal Density only
  so far. But even here, it can still be useful to create variations of a song
  part that might appear in variations throughout the song. You could even
  repeat the process for each section: Create a maximally dense verse, a
  maximally dense chorus, etc., each of which serves as the parent for smaller
  variations of the corresponding sections.
