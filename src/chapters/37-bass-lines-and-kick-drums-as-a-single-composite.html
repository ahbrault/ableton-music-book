    <h1>Bass Lines and Kick Drums as a Single Composite</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You’ve learned all of the engineering tricks and technical solutions for a
      clean, well-defined low end. You use sidechain compression on your bass
      lines and EQ to remove unnecessary low-frequency information on every
      track besides kick and bass. But somehow, you’re just not able to achieve
      the same clarity and definition in the bass as the tracks you admire. You
      know you’re doing everything right technically, but things still sound
      muddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most commonly discussed areas in music production is how to
      deal with issues in the low end. The solutions provided are almost always
      on the
      <i>production </i>side:
    </p>
    <ul id="l25">
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          Use EQ to create space for the bass in the kick drum’s track, and vice
          versa.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          Use EQ on every other track to remove low end, which makes room for
          both kick and bass while reducing overall signal level.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          Use sidechain compression to automatically reduce the gain of the bass
          when the kick is sounding.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But what’s discussed much less frequently is how to solve these problems
      on the <i>musical </i>side. Here are some compositional ideas for
      improving the clarity of low end.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Rather than thinking of your kick and bass as two separate musical lines,
      try to think of them as a single composite monophonic line. In this
      scenario, you not only can’t have more than one bass note playing
      simultaneously, you also can’t play a bass note at the same time as the
      kick. This requires you to make compositional decisions; how can you
      create a bass line that fits between the notes in your kick drum pattern
      (and vice versa)?
    </p>
    <p>
      In some genres (such as trance and some flavors of commercial EDM), bass
      notes are commonly placed only on offbeats, while the kick drum notes
      occur on every downbeat. This is a simple way of creating a single
      composite line and is a defining characteristic of music in these genres.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image below is an example of a characteristic trance bass line (the
      red notes), with the kick drum pattern added below (the blue notes).
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="508"
              height="238"
              src="/images/chapters/37-bass-lines-and-kick-drums-as-a-single-composite/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Other genres have less strict “rules” governing the relationship between
      kick and bass drum. In techno or house, for example, the kick drum is
      still often placed on every beat, but bass lines might be much more
      rhythmically intricate. Here’s an example of a more detailed bass line
      (again shown alongside the kick drum notes) that still adheres to the
      notion of the kick and bass elements forming a monophonic composite.
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="509"
              height="238"
              src="/images/chapters/37-bass-lines-and-kick-drums-as-a-single-composite/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Notice that, in both of the above examples, neither the beginnings
      <i>nor the endings </i>of the bass line notes ever overlap the kick drum
      notes (or each other). Provided your kick and bass sounds are short, these
      patterns should create a very clean, truly monophonic composite, which
      should help maintain sonic clarity in the low end. But the duration of
      sounds can have a big impact on the effectiveness of this type of writing,
      and what you see in your patterns may not represent the reality of what
      you hear. For example, 808-style kick drums often sustain for a long time,
      so even though you’ve programmed short notes in your MIDI editor, the
      resultant sounds may still overlap, causing low- end interference. On the
      other hand, there may be some situations in which zero overlap can sound
      clipped and unnatural, and sustained notes make more musical sense. In
      these cases, you can still achieve a lot of the benefits of this composite
      technique by at least making sure that the attacks of the notes never
      overlap. Here’s an example of long, sustained bass notes but with the note
      onsets themselves still carefully composed to stay out of the way of the
      kick drum line.
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="505"
              height="230"
              src="/images/chapters/37-bass-lines-and-kick-drums-as-a-single-composite/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      If, after applying these techniques, you find that you’re still having
      problems with low-end clarity, you can always go back and apply the
      production tips mentioned previously. And since you’ve already composed
      your way out of the most severe issues, techniques like sidechain
      compression and low-cut EQing may now have a much more pronounced effect.
    </p>

      ~ Note: In the examples mentioned here, the kick drum pattern has been
      added purely as a visual reference. But it might make sense for you to
      actually do this in your own music by copying the notes of the kick drum
      clips, pasting them into your bass clips, and then deactivating or muting
      them so they don’t make sound. This creates a clear visual relationship
      between the bass and kick lines, making it easier to write as if they were
      a single line.
