<h1>Creating Melodies 1: Contour</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  When you listen to music that inspires you, the melodies are strong,
  memorable, and hummable. In contrast, your melodies feel weak, aimless, and
  wandering.
</p>
<p>
  Writing a good melody is challenging. Here are some ideas for writing better
  melodies by thinking about their <i>contour</i>.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  The term contour is used to refer to the shape of a melody over time— whether
  the notes rise to higher pitches, fall to lower ones, remain at the same
  pitch, or some combination of these. Additionally, we use contour to discuss
  whether a melody moves by adjacent notes (known as <i>conjunct motion </i>or
  <i>motion by step</i>) or by larger intervals (known as
  <i>disjunct motion </i>or <i>motion by leap</i>).
</p>
<p>A few general rules:</p>
<ul id="l28">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Good melodies have a strong sense of balance between both aspects of
      contour: rise vs. fall and conjunct motion vs. disjunct motion. For
      example, if a melody rises for a while, it might make sense for it to then
      fall by roughly the same amount.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      If a melody has moved by step for a while, a good choice might be to then
      proceed by leap in the opposite direction. The converse also applies:
      Commonly, a melody that has moved by leap will then move by step in the
      opposite direction. One situation in which this might not be necessary is
      when a melody is simply an arpeggiation of a chord in the harmony. In
      these cases, the leaps between chord
    </p>
    <p>
      tones may sound “complete” even without stepwise resolution in the
      opposite direction.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      Good melodies often have a single peak note. That is, the highest pitch in
      the melody occurs only once. Furthermore, that peak note often (although
      certainly not always) occurs on a “strong” beat. (Assuming a 4/4 meter,
      the first and third beats are considered “strong” or “on” beats while the
      second and fourth are considered “weak” or “off” beats. As you subdivide
      beats into shorter note values such as eighths and sixteenths, the same
      rule applies. That is, the odd-numbered subdivisions are perceived as
      stronger than the even-numbered ones.)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s consider an example of a melody that (mostly) follows these rules:</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="514" height="206" src="/images/chapters/42-creating-melodies-1-contour/image-1.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The melody opens with a large leap up, which is immediately followed by two
  notes that step down. This pattern is then repeated in the next passage.
  Following this, we “break” the rules briefly to reach the peak note: A leap up
  is followed by two steps up. The second half of the melody also strays a bit
  more from the rules. Bar 3 begins with a descending stepwise figure which is
  then followed by a leap in the same direction. Next, we step up, and then leap
  down. The final gesture breaks the rules once again: We step up and then
  continue upward by leap to the last note.
</p>
<p>
  The general contour of the melody is a kind of arc: We start from the lowest
  note in the passage and climb gradually to the highest note at roughly the
  halfway point of the melody, before gradually descending again to cover
  roughly the same amount of space in the second half.
</p>

<p>
  As you listen to other melodies with contour in mind, you’ll find that most
  (including the one discussed earlier) don’t follow these guidelines 100
  percent of the time. But in general, you’ll find that the contour of most good
  melodies maintains a balance between ascent and descent and stepwise and
  leapwise motion.
