<h1>Repetition and Insistence</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You struggle to create bass lines, chord progressions, and melodies that work
  well together. But some music seems to work perfectly without any of these
  relationships. The notes seem almost arbitrary, and yet they always sound
  “right.” What’s happening in this music and how can you use these techniques
  in your own work?
</p>
<p>
  How is it that some music—like house or trance—depends so heavily on harmonic
  relationships, while other music—like acid or minimal techno—often seems to
  work without any notion of harmony at all?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>Repetition can have a powerful and unexpected effect on the listener.</p>

    >As long as it’s relatively brief, the most angular, atonal musical pattern
    will eventually sound completely appropriate if it’s repeated persistently
    enough. Through regular exposure and insistence, we can’t help but find
    patterns in chaos. As discussed in Implied Rhythm in Short Loops (page </a
  >120), you can use this perceptual illusion to find interesting rhythms in any
  source material, but you can also use it to create melodic patterns and bass
  lines.
</p>
<p>
  It’s common in acid techno, for example, for bass lines to be comprised of
  notes that are essentially arbitrary. But because these patterns are both
  short and endlessly repeated, they sound perfectly natural. This doesn’t work
  for every genre—if you’re writing music that’s rich in harmony, with long,
  sustained chords supported by a bass line, it’s likely that the bass notes
  really matter. But you’ll note that in acid and minimal techno, there’s often
  no harmony at all. This allows for more freedom in how melodies and bass lines
  can be constructed, and dissonance often works perfectly well in this music.
</p>
<p>
  If you have access to a plug-in or instrument that can generate random
  sequences, try feeding a typical 303-style monophonic bass synth and see what
  kind of results you get. At first listen, some patterns might sound unusable.
  But allow yourself to listen to the pattern loop a number of times and you’ll
  find that it will start to become musical. In principle, this will work with
  almost any pattern.

    >Of course, your ear needs to be the final judge of the results, and you’re
    ultimately responsible for any random processes that you apply to your music
    (see Randomness and Responsibility (page </a
  >250)). But in many cases, you can make almost any pattern work if you’re
  willing to repeat it with enough insistence.
