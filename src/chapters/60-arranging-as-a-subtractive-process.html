    <em hidden="true">Part: ‌Problems of Finishing</em>
    <h1>Arranging as a Subtractive Process</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You have more than enough ideas to make up a finished song but don’t know
      how to actually put the arrangement together. Even the process of
      arranging sounds like an intimidating commitment. How can you even begin,
      let alone finish?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the context of music creation in a DAW, the arrangement refers to the
      layout of the parts of your song along a timeline. You may have assembled
      a rich pool of material, but the actual act of putting that material in
      some kind of order that unfolds over time is what will eventually turn
      that material into a finished song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting from “pile of stuff” to “song” is a difficult process, both
      conceptually and technically. The most common way people approach creating
      an arrangement is the most obvious one: Gradually fill the empty
      arrangement with various combinations of the material you’ve made, moving
      from left (the beginning) to right (the end). In this workflow, the
      arrangement timeline is analogous to a blank canvas to which you apply
      paint until a finished painting appears from what was originally empty,
      white space.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process works, of course. But facing emptiness can be scary. Even
      though you’ve already put in a considerable amount of time preparing the
      materials that you plan to use, you now face something that might feel
      like a reset to zero. Beginnings are hard, and a blank canvas (or empty
      timeline) can be a difficult mental bridge to cross.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      If you’re finding that you’re stuck at the arranging stage, here’s one
      process that might help: Start by immediately filling your entire
      arrangement with material, on every track. Spend as little time as
      possible thinking about this step; the goal right now isn’t to try to
      create a good arrangement. You just want to start with something rather
      than nothing. It’s OK that you don’t know how long the song will
      eventually be. Just fill up an average song’s worth of time (or even more)
      in whatever way is the fastest for your particular DAW—by copy/ pasting
      blocks of clips over and over again, via a “duplicate” command, or (in
      some DAWs) by dragging the right edges of clips to extend them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you’ve already given some thought to how your material will be
      divided. Maybe you’ve named certain clips things like “Verse” and “Chorus”
      so that you can better organize them when arranging. Don’t worry about any
      of that for now. In fact, don’t even try to use all of the material you
      have. Just grab a pile of ideas from each track, and fill the empty space.
      This process should take no more than about 20 seconds. If you’re spending
      more time than this, it probably means you’re trying to make creative
      decisions. For example, maybe you’re thinking “I already know that this
      chunk of ideas will go before this chunk of ideas, so to save time later,
      I’ll just lay them out in that order now.” Resist the temptation to
      organize anything in this phase, and simply move as fast as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example, here’s a 6-minute arrangement timeline, filled as quickly
      as possible.
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="512"
              height="131"
              src="/images/chapters/60-arranging-as-a-subtractive-process/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="512"
              height="131"
              src="/images/chapters/60-arranging-as-a-subtractive-process/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Now that you’ve filled the timeline, the process of actually making your
      arrangement into music becomes one of subtraction rather than addition. If
      the traditional arranging workflow is analogous to painting, the
      subtractive workflow is analogous to sculpting. You’re beginning with a
      solid block of raw material and then gradually chipping away at it,
      creating space where there used to be stuff, rather than filling space
      that used to be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be a much more productive way to work for a number of reasons.
      For example, it’s often easier to hear when something is bad than it is to
      imagine something good. If a particular combination of ideas doesn’t make
      musical sense, you can generally feel this right away, and the steps to
      fix it may be obvious: Maybe an element is simply too loud, or the bass
      line clashes with the harmony. And because you’re listening back to an
      actual flow of sound over time, you’ll probably have an intuitive sense of
      when a song section has been going on for too long—your own taste will
      tell you that it’s time for a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re working in a genre in which textural density tends to increase
      and decrease as the song progresses, you may already have your “thickest”
      sections of material finished at this point. You may find that you’re
      actually able to work backwards from the end of the song towards the
      beginning, removing more and more elements as you go back in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      ~ Bonus tip: Most DAWs provide a way to insert or delete chunks of empty
      time in the middle of an arrangement. When using a subtractive process,
      these tools can be extremely helpful. For example, you may have finished
      editing work on what you originally thought would be two adjacent sections
      of material, but then realized that something else should come in between,
      or that the first section needs to be twice as long. Inserting time in the
      middle automatically shifts everything after this point to the right,
      which is much faster and safer than trying to cut and paste many tracks’
      worth of material manually. Or maybe you’ve realized that a section you’ve
      been editing is too long. If your DAW has it, use the delete time command
      to remove the excess material, which will cause everything to the right to
      automatically shift to the left to fill in the gap.
