<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Finishing</em></p>
<h1>Unique Events</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  <a href="#bookmark119" class="s76">You’ve finished an arrangement, and you’re generally happy with it. It has
    a variety of sections, you’ve created Fuzzy Boundaries (page 99)</a> between them, they all seem
  to last for the right amount of time, and there are contrasts and appropriate
  levels of tension and release. But somehow, it still sounds like “loop
  music”—repetitive. You can’t consider it finished in this state, because it
  feels too predictable; it won’t offer any surprises beyond the first listen.
</p>
<p>
  Modern DAWs suggest a workflow that combines loops into larger arrangements,
  and many genres of electronic music are defined by repeating patterns. But
  perfectly repeated loops can become tedious after a while. Here is one
  technique for creating a sense of surprise within an otherwise loop-based
  context.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  At various points in your arrangement, insert unique events—sounds, gestures,
  or variations that occur only once and are never repeated. There are a few
  different types of unique events you can try:
</p>
<ul id="l32">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <h4>
      Single <i>events</i><span class="p">. These are short samples or sounds that can be strategically placed
        throughout your arrangement to add a layer of unpredictability. These
        can be almost anything—pitched or unpitched percussion sounds, single
        notes or chords played on an instrument that is otherwise never heard,
        etc. A good source of single events is the sample library you already
        have. Try finding unusual samples that would otherwise be out of context
        for your</span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      song. Depending on where you place these events, the effect on the
      listener can be quite varied. For example, placing single events at or
      near formal boundaries can make them feel like part of a transition, while
      placing them at formally insignificant moments can be quite jarring and
      interruptive, especially if they’re also placed in odd rhythmic locations
      that play “against” the grid of the song.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <h4>
      Single <i>musical gestures</i><span class="p">. These are short phrases or one-time alterations to otherwise
        consistently repeating patterns. It’s common to vary a musical phrase
        near a formal transition, but it can be especially interesting if you
        also create one-time variations within the middle of a phrase. Some DAWs
        offer various types of note- transformation tools, which can apply
        processes to a selection of MIDI notes to change some or all of them in
        a way that maintains a relationship to the original. These tools can
        provide an interesting way to create one-off musical gestures.</span>
    </h4>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <h4>
      Single <i>processing gestures</i><span class="p">. Consider applying dramatic, one-time changes to the effects
        processing on one or more tracks. For example, set up a chain of effects
        but leave them bypassed or off. Then use automation to make them active
        only once before disabling them again. Single processing gestures can be
        especially disruptive if they’re quite short or if they occur in unusual
        places in a phrase.</span>
    </h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Depending on the genre you’re working in, you can be quite creative with these
  unique events. Unless you’re working in a very commercial context, you don’t
  generally need to worry that “weird” (i.e., out of key, out of rhythm, etc.)
  unique events will ruin the texture of the music. But note that you should
  probably use them sparingly within a single song. Even though each individual
  event occurs only once, using too many unique events in a song can create its
  own sense of predictability.
</p>
<p>
  Listeners will begin to expect that something jarring or unusual will occur,
  which reduces the effectiveness of the technique.
