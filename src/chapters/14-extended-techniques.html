<h1>Extended Techniques</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re generally bored with the sounds that you’ve been using. Your real-world
  samples all sound too real, and your electronic sounds all sound too
  conventionally electronic. You’re looking for something that bridges the gap
  between the rawness of acoustic sounds and the flexibility of synthesis.
  You’ve tried using effects to process your sounds but this just feels like
  adding a fresh coat of paint. You need something really new.
</p>
<p>
  Sampling from the acoustic world brings a layer of “realness” to electronic
  music productions that is difficult to achieve using synthesis alone. And
  although samplers and effects can help to turn real-world sources into
  something radically different, here are some lo-tech ways to get entirely new
  sounds from acoustic sources.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Although it’s always possible to use samplers and effects to modify source
  sounds into something completely different, it can also be inspiring to work
  with a sound that’s already unusual on its own. Field recordings, found
  sounds, and other types of non-instrumental source material have long been
  used as fodder for samplers, but there is also a world of new sound
  possibilities available from instruments you already know.
</p>

  The term “extended techniques” refers to unconventional approaches to sound
  production using conventional instruments. Probably the most familiar extended
  technique is the “prepared piano” made famous by John Cage (among others).
  Cage’s scores for prepared piano call for objects such as bolts and rubber
  erasers to be placed on or between the piano strings, or on the hammers or
  dampers. The resultant sound varies widely depending on the particular type of
  preparation used, but often sounds like a diverse collection of metallic
  percussion instruments.
</p>
<p>
  Another extended technique that can yield great results is the use of stringed
  instrument bows on other objects. A lot of contemporary percussion music, for
  example, calls for bowed vibraphone bars, cymbals, gongs, and other metal
  objects. In fact, almost any piece of resonant metal can be activated via
  bowing. If you have access to a bow, try bowing pots and pans, metal
  furniture, etc. And if you don’t have access to a real bow, you can create
  makeshift bows out of fishing line.

<p>
  There are a variety of possible extended techniques for woodwind and brass
  instruments. If you have access to these instruments (as well as adventurous
  people who can play them), try playing them without their reeds or
  mouthpieces, playing only the reed or mouthpiece, or even using the mouthpiece
  from one instrument on another “wrong” instrument. In some cases, this will
  produce no sound at all, but you can sometimes get very interesting timbres by
  resonating these instruments in new ways.
</p>

<p>
  Woodwind and brass instruments are also capable of producing multiple
  simultaneous pitches, which are known as <i>multiphonics</i>. For woodwinds,
  multiphonics are produced by using certain unconventional fingerings, while on
  brass instruments they can be produced by humming additional pitches while
  playing normally.
</p>
<p>
  In recent years, the concept of extended techniques has moved beyond the world
  of acoustic instruments and into the electronic domain as well. The practice
  known as <i>circuit bending </i>is the physical modification of electronic
  sound-making devices with the goal of creating sounds those devices were never
  intended to make. Common circuit bending targets are cheap electronic
  instruments, children’s toys, etc. Circuit bent instruments can be a great
  source of new timbres, particularly because they often produce very unusual
  sounds while still retaining the lo-fi character of the original device.
