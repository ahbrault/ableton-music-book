<h1>Thinking Like an Amateur</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Ever since you started getting “serious” about your music-making, you’ve
  secretly started having less fun with it. You (vaguely) remember a time when
  you didn’t feel this way; when you had no aspirations to be a professional,
  making music was always a great way for you to relax. But now that you’ve
  become concerned with “success,” your sense of childlike joy at just making
  sounds has disappeared and has been overtaken by your desire to
  <i>finish songs</i>— or even scarier: <i>get famous</i>.
</p>

  Although this book is mostly about finding ways to get music done, sometimes
  there are benefits to forgetting about that way of thinking entirely and
  instead just enjoying the process of making music as a goal in itself.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  When someone is referred to as an amateur, this is usually meant to imply that
  they’re less qualified or less talented than a professional in the same field.
  An amateur, it’s assumed, is someone who would have liked to be a professional
  but who was unable to reach that level. But despite these negative
  connotations, the word “amateur” actually just means “lover of,” and there are
  many amateurs in all fields who are working at a very high level. And there
  are still many more who aren’t necessarily great at what they do but are
  having a great time.
</p>

  Think about something you consider a hobby, something (besides music) that you
  do with your free time. Maybe you run marathons, or brew beer, or take
  wildlife photographs. Whatever it is, have you ever even considered doing it
  professionally? Probably not. And most likely this isn’t because you’re not
  good enough (and whether you are or not is probably irrelevant to your
  decision), but rather because the very fact that it’s a hobby means that it’s
  something you do that <i>isn’t work</i>. Instead, it’s a chance to spend time
  on something fun and fulfilling that doesn’t saddle you with any outside
  pressure to succeed, earn a living, etc.
</p>

  Electronic musicians, more so than musicians working in other genres, seem to
  have a more difficult time simply engaging with music as a hobby. Perhaps this
  is because tools like DAWs are fundamentally designed around a recording
  mentality. Think about people you’ve met who own an acoustic guitar. Just
  pulling it out and playing it for a few minutes while sitting on the couch may
  be the extent of their musical aspirations. And they don’t see this as
  failure. They’re not lamenting their inability to get gigs or write more music
  or get record deals.
</p>
<p>
  They’re having exactly the relationship with music that they want. In fact,
  they’re usually not even recording what they play; once it’s in the air, it’s
  gone.
</p>

<p>
  By definition, being a professional means having to spend at least some amount
  of time thinking about the marketplace. Is there an audience for the music
  you’re making? If not, you’re guaranteed to fail. Amateurs, on the other hand,
  never have to think about this question at all. This frees them to make music
  entirely for themselves, on their own terms.
</p>
<p>
  One easy way to do this is to put yourself into a musical context in which you
  actually <i>are </i>an amateur—by experimenting with a genre in which you have
  no prior experience. Are you a committed hip-hop producer? Try making a house
  track. Your expectations are bound to be lower, simply because you have no
  prior successes or failures against which to gauge your current work. Even if
  you hate the results, it’s likely that you’ll learn something from the
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  Even if you do aspire to make a living out of creating original music, it
  might be helpful to think like an amateur in order to lower your stress and
  bring the fun back to your music-making time. Amateurs often have a genuinely
  more pleasurable experience than professionals working in the same field, and
  this is almost certainly because they’re free from outside pressure. If you
  can instill this mindset into your own work, you’ll probably have both better
  results and a better time.
