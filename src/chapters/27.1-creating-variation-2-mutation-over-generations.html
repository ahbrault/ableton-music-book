<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’ve come up with a great-sounding seed of a musical idea. But now that you
  have it, you find that you don’t know how to proceed. Maybe it’s a few notes
  or a few bars, but it’s definitely not long enough to be a finished piece. You
  keep listening to the promising idea over and over again, unable to see a
  direction that will get you from here to a song.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of methods for generating many new ideas from the seed of
  one simple idea. Here is one recipe.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Make a single duplicate of the initial idea. Edit this duplicate until you
  have made only one meaningful change. You’ll ultimately need to use your own
  taste and intuition to determine what “meaningful” means in the context of
  this particular idea, but the broad categories to consider are the fundamental
  parameters of music:
</p>
<ul>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Sound: changes to the timbre</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Harmony: changes to the chords</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Melody: changes to the foreground line</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Rhythm: changes to the timing of events</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Form: changes to the structure or distribution of smaller-scale components
      within the idea
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you’re satisfied with the change that you’ve made to the duplicated idea,
  repeat the process. But this time, begin by creating a duplicate of the
  duplicate (rather than the original). Now make one meaningful change to this
  third-generation duplicate. Try not to go “backwards”; that is, don’t simply
  undo the change that you made in the previous generation. Continue this
  process a number of times (maybe eight or so), each time using the previous
  variation as the seed for the next one.
</p>
<p>
  What you have now is a collection of “descendant” ideas, each of which is the
  direct offspring of the previous idea, but which can all be traced back to the
  original “ancestor.” Although you’ve made only one meaningful change to each
  idea, all of them have also inherited the changes from all of the preceding
  generations and so may become increasingly remote from the original ancestor.
