<h1>Procrastination and Timeboxing</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  In the abstract, you know that you want to make music. But the actual process
  of doing it sometimes feels like torture.
</p>
<p>
  You know that working on music can bring moments of bliss: When the work is
  going well, the music sounds great, and you’re in a state of flow. But there
  seem to be as many or more moments of agony. Despite our best intentions,
  there are lots of reasons why we sometimes procrastinate, including fear of
  failure, fear of success, and simple laziness.

<p>
  <a href="#bookmark114" class="a">In the chapter called On Work (page </a>89),
  we discuss the inevitable reality that working is the only way to actually
  make progress. But here is a tip for actually getting to work.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  If you’re a chronic procrastinator, you’re not alone. Many creative (and
  non-creative) people suffer from task aversion and can find any excuse to
  avoid getting done the work that really needs to get done. One strategy for
  overcoming procrastination that’s commonly used in the software development
  world is known as <i>timeboxing</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Timeboxing simply means setting a fixed amount of time for a particular task.
  The amount of time you choose is up to you, but it should be short enough so
  that it’s easily manageable by even the most determined procrastinators. For
  example, you might decide to spend 20 minutes on sound design. Next, set a
  timer, work only on sound design, and stop when the timer goes off. Finally,
  take a short break (five minutes or so). Then repeat the process, perhaps with
  another unrelated type of task (e.g., drum programming, arranging, etc.).
  After four or five stretches of this timed work/break combo, you might want to
  take a longer break.
</p>
<p>
  Short timeboxes work because they break apart intimidating, open- ended tasks
  into easily manageable chunks; no matter how painful creative work is, anyone
  can do it for 20 minutes. It’s important that you really work during those 20
  minutes—intensely and without interruption. But it’s equally important that
  you stop at the end. No matter how productive you are or how close you feel to
  entering a real flow state, stick to the timebox. This may seem
  counterintuitive; after all, if you’ve finally managed to trick yourself into
  enjoying the process, doesn’t it make sense to run with that as far as your
  attention span will allow? But the reason this is dangerous (at least at
  first) is because it runs the risk of setting you up for a long work session
  that eventually becomes frustrating or disappointing. When this happens, your
  memory of the session will be that it was both bad and long-lasting, which may
  further reinforce your procrastination tendencies. On the other hand, if you
  stop even while it’s fun, you’re more likely to be energized and ready to move
  forward again once the break is over.
</p>

<p>
  After you spend a few days sticking to a systematic timeboxing routine, you
  may find that your latent procrastination starts to feel less overbearing, and
  you feel the urge to just do uninterrupted work. At this point, you might
  first try using longer and longer timeboxes. Eventually, you may find yourself
  able to focus without assistance at all and can then consider your
  procrastination cured. And if you find yourself slipping back to your old
  work-avoidance habits later, simply try using the timer again.
