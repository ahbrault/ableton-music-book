    <h1>Creating Melodies 2: Using Motives</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      When you listen to music that inspires you, the melodies are strong,
      memorable, and hummable. In contrast, your melodies feel weak, aimless,
      and wandering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing a good melody is challenging. Here are some ideas for writing
      better melodies by using <i>motives</i>.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Part of the reason writing melodies is so intimidating is that it’s easy
      to imagine a melody as just a long string of notes without any internal
      logic. But melodies often have an inherent formal structure that is a sort
      of small-scale version of the formal structure used to construct a whole
      song. The smallest recognizable fragment of a melody is called a motive,
      and melodies are often constructed from just one or two motives. Motives
      are simple patterns that can be combined, repeated, and altered in various
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s an example of a melody from Daft Punk’s “Doin’ It Right” that’s
      built from variations of just a single motive:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="514"
              height="176"
              src="/images/chapters/43-creating-melodies-2-using-motives/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>And here is the same example in musical notation:</p>
    <img
      src="/images/chapters/43-creating-melodies-2-using-motives/image-2.webp"
    />

    <p>
      In the MIDI example, the boxes outline each of the four sections of this
      melody, and each is a variation of the same five-note motive. In the first
      two bars, the first four notes are an ascending stepwise motive of two
      notes, repeated twice, while the fifth note is another stepwise ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second two bars, we again have the initial four notes built from
      the repeated two-note motive, but the fifth note is now a leap downward.
      The contour of the whole melody forms an arc, beginning
      <a href="#bookmark141" class="a"
        >and ending on the same note (see Creating Melodies 1: Contour (page </a
      >178)). In this example, a rich, usable melody is constructed simply by
      creating variations of a single five-note motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melody in the chorus of Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy” is a bit more complex
      but still uses variations of only two alternating motives. Here is the
      melody as MIDI notes:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="176"
              src="/images/chapters/43-creating-melodies-2-using-motives/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>And here is the same example in musical notation:</p>
    <img
      src="/images/chapters/43-creating-melodies-2-using-motives/image-4.webp"
    />

    <p>
      Each bar contains one of the two motives and these alternate every other
      bar. In the MIDI example, these are labeled as A and B. The A motives are
      repeated identically each time they occur, while the B motives are subject
      to variation. Bar four (labeled B’) is essentially just a transposed
      version of bar two, with a slight rhythmic embellishment. And bar eight is
      just a more embellished version of bar four. Bar six is an identical
      repeat of bar two. The overall melody has a descending contour, as do each
      of the component motives.

        >As these examples show, there are many different ways to expand just
        one or two simple motives into a full melody through the use of
        variation. For some ideas about the kinds of variations you can use, see
        Creating Variations 3: Note Transformations (page </a
      ><a href="#bookmark84" class="a"
        >108). And identifying the motives in a melody can be a useful exercise
        when doing Active Listening (page </a
      >22).
