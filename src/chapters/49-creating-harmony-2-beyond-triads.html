<h1>Creating Harmony 2: Beyond Triads</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  From reading the previous chapter, you understand the fundamentals of triads
  and diatonic harmony, as well as how to use these tools to create usable chord
  progressions. But these chords lack the complexity and “color” that you hear
  in genres like jazz and even some house music. What else is possible?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  There are many types of chords besides diatonic triads. But the basic tools
  that we use to build those triads can also be used to create a much wider
  range of more complex chords. Here are a number of these chords, as well as
  some ideas about how to use them:
</p>
<p class="s7">Seventh Chords</p>
<p>
  We know that triads are built by choosing a starting note (or root) and then
  adding the third and fifth notes above it. But we can extend this pattern by
  adding the seventh note above the root. The four-note chord that results is
  (conveniently) called a <i>seventh chord</i>. Here are the diatonic seventh
  chords in C Major (shown in both a MIDI piano roll and conventional notation):

<p>
  As with major, minor, and diminished triads, seventh chords also have a
  quality, although the situation becomes slightly more complex because the
  triad that serves as the basis of the chord does not necessarily have the same
  quality as the seventh itself. For example, the I and IV triads are both
  major, and so are the corresponding I<span class="s21">7 </span>and IV<span class="s21">7 </span>chords.
</p>
<p>
  This is because we define a major seventh as the interval distance of 11 half
  steps from the root to the seventh of the chord. But the V<span class="s21">7 </span>is very interesting. The V triad is major, but the seventh is minor—ten half
  steps between the root and the seventh. This combination of a major triad with
  a minor seventh on top is called a <i>dominant </i>seventh chord and has a
  strong feeling of “wanting” to resolve to the I chord. The vii<span class="s55">ø</span><span class="s56">7 </span><span class="s57">is another interesting case. Here, the triad is diminished while the</span>
  seventh is minor. This is known as a <i>half-diminished seventh chord</i>.
</p>
<p>
  With the exception of the V<span class="s21">7</span><a href="#bookmark149" class="a">, which is very commonly used to resolve back to I, seventh chords are used
    less frequently than triads in many genres. But they are the fundamental
    harmonic building blocks used in jazz and related genres. In fact, almost
    any “normal” functional chord progression (as explained in Creating Harmony
    1: The Basics (page </a>203)) can be given a jazz flavor by replacing the triads with their
  corresponding diatonic seventh chords. Jazz often uses sevenths in
  “non-functional” ways as well, and jazz progressions often consist
  <a href="#bookmark152" class="a">of chains of seventh chords that lead to one another primarily by smoothly
    connecting the individual voices within the chords and maintaining common
    tones whenever possible (rather than by use of predictable functionality).
    For more about how to make these kinds of progressions, see the chapter
    about Voice Leading and Inversions (page </a>225).
</p>

<p class="s7">Further Extensions: 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths</p>
<p>
  We can extend this method of constructing triads and seventh chords even
  further simply by adding additional thirds to the top. With one additional
  note, we get 9th chords:
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>

<img src="/images/chapters/49-creating-harmony-2-beyond-triads/image-4.webp">

<p>Add one more note to get 11th chords:</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<img src="/images/chapters/49-creating-harmony-2-beyond-triads/image-6.webp">

<p>And finally, yet one more note creates 13th chords:</p>

<p>
  Note that I have left the Roman numeral analysis off of these chords. This is
  because the quality of these chords quickly becomes very complex, and also
  very ambiguous—in many cases, there is no single “correct” analysis for these
  large chords. It’s also because these types of harmonies are not normally used
  in a functional context (with the exception of sometimes serving as
  replacements for conventional progressions of triads).
</p>
<p>
  It is rare for keyboard players to play every note of these very large, dense
  harmonies. This is partly because it’s difficult to quickly navigate the
  keyboard while playing seven-note chords, but also because the sound of these
  harmonies can be implied by playing only the most “important” notes in the
  structure—commonly the highest notes in the extension, plus maybe the third.
  The root is commonly omitted entirely, usually because it’s filled in by the
  bass or another instrument. Although it is no problem to program a DAW to play
  every voice of huge chords like this, you may still want to avoid doing so
  because you can quickly overpower a mix with such enormous blocks of harmony.
</p>

<p>
  Although diatonic 9th, 11th, and 13th chords are common in jazz, it is also
  common to alter one or more of the notes in the chords to create even more
  interesting colors. Altering a chord simply means replacing one or more of the
  notes with a note that is one half step away. Some common alterations include
  lowering the fifth note, as in this 9th chord:

<p>
  Notice that these chords are almost identical. In the first example, we’ve
  lowered the fifth of the chord, while in the second we’ve maintained the fifth
  while adding a raised 11th on top. But the lowered fifth (a G<span class="s18">b</span>) and the raised 11th (an F<span class="s18">#</span>) are the
  <i>same pitch</i>. This is an example of the kind of subtlety and ambiguity
  that gives these kinds of dense chords their sophisticated flavor.
</p>
<p>
  You may have also noticed an interesting characteristic of the 13th
  chords—each of them contains <i>every single note </i>of the C Major scale,
  just starting in a different place. This leads to our next topic…
</p>

<p class="s7">Non-Triadic Chords</p>
<p>
  Since 9th, 11th, and 13th chords all include intervals larger than an octave,
  we can create closely related harmonies by simply “folding” the upper
  extensions down so that they’re compacted into a single octave. For example,
  compacting our 13th chord built on C results in this:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="514" height="195" src="/images/chapters/49-creating-harmony-2-beyond-triads/image-14.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<img src="/images/chapters/49-creating-harmony-2-beyond-triads/image-15.webp">

<p>
  Although this contains exactly the same pitches as the original 13th, it is
  voiced using adjacent notes rather than every other note. Chords built on
  adjacent notes are called <i>secundal </i>chords or <i>clusters</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Now that we know we can build chords from thirds or from seconds, it follows
  that we can build chords from other intervals as well. Chords built by
  stacking notes that are five semitones apart are known as
  <i>quartal </i>chords, while stacking notes seven semitones apart yields
  <i>quintal </i>chords. Here are examples of five-note quartal and quintal
  chords built from C:

  As with the extended chords discussed previously, these very “wide” chords can
  be compacted to fit within a single octave, often resulting (again) in
  secundal constructions. In fact, the two chords used in the previous example
  form a quite nice two-chord progression when condensed in this way:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

      <td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<img src="/images/chapters/49-creating-harmony-2-beyond-triads/image-19.webp">

<p>
  Note that these non-triadic harmonies usually aren’t considered to have major
  or minor quality; in most contexts, they exist outside of the major/minor
  domain. Regardless, they are commonly used in jazz and modern classical music,
  again largely connected in progressions via voice leading rather than
  goal-oriented functionality.
</p>
<p>
  This is just a sampling of the kinds of chords that are available when we
  expand our palette beyond conventional triads. But even using this expanded
  repertoire should allow you to come up with more colorful harmony than would
  be possible with triads alone.
</p>

<p class="s7">A Real-World Example</p>
<p>
  The classic house track “Can You Feel It” by Mr. Fingers is a great example of
  some of these types of extended harmonies. The progression in the pad sound
  that occurs all through the track is only three chords, but they’re exactly
  right. They also demonstrate how analysis of this type of harmony isn’t always
  an exact science:

<p>The song is in the key of A minor. So what are these chords?</p>
<ol id="l31">
  <li data-list-text="1.">
    <h4>
      A minor 9:
      <span class="p">At first glance, this labeling may seem strange. Why is this an A chord
        if it doesn’t contain an A? The reason is the bass line, which consists
        of lots of repeated A and E notes underneath the harmony. Thus we have
        the bass line’s root (A), plus the third (C), the fifth (E), seventh
        (G), and the ninth (B).</span>

        which gives it an unusual, unstable color. And if we ignore the A in the
        bass, we could call this a simple E minor 7, which suggests a somewhat
        more functional progression: v - I. So is there a “right” analysis? Not
        really. The ambiguity is part of what makes the progression
        interesting.</span>
