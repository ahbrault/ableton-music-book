<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Progressing</em></p>
<h1>Dramatic Arc</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You can’t seem to create an arrangement that really feels like a convincing
  musical journey. You can put various song parts together and move them around,
  but nothing you do seems to create the feeling you get from listening to your
  favorite music. You find it very hard to create a sense of drama or tension
  and release. You don’t understand how to structure musical time convincingly
  over the course of 4-10 minutes (and are amazed that a good DJ can do it over
  the course of hours!).
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  There are many different ways to organize musical materials over time, but one
  of the most successful is a three-part structure called the
  <i>dramatic arc </i>that is also commonly used in theater, film, and other
  narrative or dramatic media.
</p>
<p>
  The dramatic arc refers to three main sections: exposition, climax, and
  dénouement, which are connected by rising action at the beginning and falling
  action towards the end. A graphical representation of this arc (known as
  <i>Freytag’s pyramid</i>) is below:
</p>

<p class="s74">Falling</p>

<p class="s74">Action</p>

<p class="s74">Climax</p>

<p class="s74">Action</p>

<p class="s74">Rising</p>

<p class="s74">Exposition Dénouement</p>

<h4>
  Exposition<span class="p"
    >: In stories, this is the introduction of characters and the setting of the
    scene. In music, the exposition is the introduction of musical materials
    (melodies, harmonic progressions, rhythmic ideas, etc.) that will appear
    through the piece.</span
  >
</h4>
<h4>
  Rising action<span class="p"
    >: This is the section when tension builds towards the climax. In stories,
    this usually means conflict between a protagonist and adversaries. In music,
    it might mean variations or mutations of the materials that were introduced
    in the exposition.</span
  >
</h4>

<h4>
  Climax<span class="p"
    >: This is the peak of dramatic tension in the work. In a story, this is
    often the “turning point” for the protagonists, the point at which fortunes
    shift from bad to good or vice versa. In music, the climax is often marked
    by a sudden increase in textural density (e.g., “the drop” in dubstep or
    EDM).</span
  >
</h4>
<h4>
  Falling action<span class="p"
    >: This is a section of relaxing tension after the climax. In stories, this
    section serves to resolve outstanding conflicts from the climax. In music,
    this section might mirror the activity from the rising action section.</span
  >
</h4>
<h4>
  Dénouement<span class="p"
    >: In stories, the dénouement is often a mirror of the exposition, in which
    characters return to normalcy after the events that make up the tension of
    the story. In music, this might mean a restatement of established musical
    materials (e.g., a repeated chorus) or a gradual dissolution (e.g., a fade
    out into silence).</span

    >While the dramatic arc is normally thought of as a formal structure for the
    piece as a whole, in music it can also be used as the structure for smaller-
    or larger-scale components. On the micro level, a single melodic idea can be
    structured as a dramatic arc; consider a melody that rises to a peak before
    falling again to its starting pitch. (An example like this is quite literal,
    with a melodic contour (see Creating Melodies 1: Contour (page </a
  >178)) that visually matches the shape
</p>
<p>
  of Freytag’s pyramid. Of course, it’s also possible to build tension without
  literally ascending to a higher pitch.) On the macro level, a good DJ set
  often follows something like a dramatic arc as well, with tension building to
  a climax over the course of an hour or more, before resolving back to a lower
  energy level over a similar amount of time.
</p>
<p>
  There are, of course, many types of musical forms that bear no resemblance to
  the conventional dramatic arc. Genres like dub or minimal techno, for example,
  generally have no clear build to a climax. In this music, dramatic tension is
  created in entirely different ways, often through careful attention to sound
  design and subtle changes
</p>

<p>
  in an otherwise static texture over time. But in some situations, using the
  dramatic arc as a model for musical form can work extremely well.
