    <h1>Creating Variation 3: Note Transformations</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You’ve come up with a great-sounding seed of a musical idea. But now that
      you have it, you find that you don’t know how to proceed. Maybe it’s a few
      notes or a few bars, but it’s definitely not long enough to be a finished
      piece. You keep listening to the promising idea over and over again,
      unable to see a direction that will get you from here to a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of methods for generating many new ideas from the seed
      of one simple idea. Here are some recipes.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Most DAWs offer a range of <i>note transformation </i>features that allow
      you to make predictable, rule-based changes to a selection of notes. The
      resulting patterns will usually have a clear, organic connection to the
      original pattern, although they can often sound quite different. Some
      types of transformations include:
    </p>
    <p class="s7">Transposition</p>
    <p>
      Transposition means shifting an entire pattern of notes up or down by a
      specific number of semitones. In a transposition operation, the
      relationship between all of the notes in the pattern will remain
      unchanged. Many DAWs provide a quick way to transpose MIDI notes, but you
      can also do this manually by simply selecting a group of notes and
      dragging them vertically or horizontally to a new position on the piano
      roll. Transposition can also be applied to audio samples, although there
      will generally be some change to the timbre of the audio as a result.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a one-measure-long MIDI phrase, followed by a version of that
      phrase that has been transposed up by five semitones:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="s7">Inversion</p>
    <p>
      Inversion (in this context) is the process of flipping a collection of
      notes “upside-down” so that the lowest note becomes the highest note and
      vice versa. The shape of the pattern and interval distance between each of
      the notes is maintained, but in the opposite direction of the original.
      This process can be applied in the MIDI domain, either via an automatic
      process built in to the DAW or by manually moving the notes. For example,
      here is a one-measure-long phrase, followed by a version of that phrase
      that has been inverted:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="s7">Retrograde or Reverse</p>
    <p>
      Retrograde means flipping a collection of notes backwards, so that the
      last note becomes the first note and vice versa. This process can be
      applied in the MIDI domain, either via an automatic process built in to
      the DAW or by manually moving the notes. Retrograde can also be applied in
      the audio domain, usually by applying a “Reverse” function to the sample.
      Note, however, that reversing a sample will also reverse the envelope
      contour of the audio itself, so the results will be quite different than a
      comparable process applied to the same MIDI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s an example of a one-measure-long MIDI phrase, followed by a version
      of that phrase that has been reversed:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-3.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Note that in this particular retrograde algorithm, the distance between
      the note <i>onsets </i>is reversed. A true mirror image would mean that
      the note ends of the original became onsets in the reversed version. While
      literal mirroring is probably easier to understand conceptually, the
      results are often not particularly musically interesting.
    </p>

    <p class="s7">Constraint to a Scale</p>
    <p>
      A passage of MIDI notes can be selectively transposed so that the
      resulting pattern contains only notes that are within a particular scale.
      Many DAWs provide some type of device specifically for this purpose. These
      devices analyze incoming MIDI notes and remap them to an arbitrary pool of
      available notes before sending them out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s an example of a one-measure-long MIDI phrase containing a somewhat
      random collection of notes, followed by a version of that phrase that has
      been constrained to the pitches within the C Major scale:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-4.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Although the example above shows the actual notes that result from a
      scale-constraint process, note that many DAWs with MIDI processing devices
      apply their processing after the notes in the clip.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to get the notes you hear back into the original clip (as in the
      previous example), follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol id="l21">
      <li data-list-text="1.">
        <p>
          Create a new MIDI track and set up your DAW’s inter-track routing so
          that the new track records the output of the original track.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="2.">
        <p>Copy the newly-recorded notes to the clipboard.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="3.">
        <p>Paste them back into the original clip.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text="4.">
        <p>Disable or remove the scale-constraint device.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="s7">Time Shifting</p>
    <p>
      A looped passage of material can be started at an arbitrary position
      within the passage. This is effectively the same as maintaining the exact
      pitches and rhythms of the original pattern, but shifting the pattern
      right or left to a new location. Some DAWs allow you to adjust the
      playback start position for a particular pattern independently of any
      other patterns. In these environments, simply moving the pattern’s start
      position achieves this effect. Here’s an example of our original one-bar
      pattern with its start marker shifted three sixteenth notes to the right:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-5.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      In other DAWs, you can manually copy the entire pattern and paste it to
      the new location with the desired offset. When shifting to the right, keep
      in mind that material near the end of the original pattern will need to be
      “wrapped around” to the beginning of the new pattern, and vice versa when
      shifting to the left.
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-6.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="s7">Pitch Rotation</p>
    <p>
      Pitch rotation is a process whereby the rhythm of a passage of notes is
      retained but the pitches from the passage are shifted to the right or left
      in time. Here’s an example of a one-measure-long MIDI phrase, followed by
      a version of that phrase that has been rotated to the right by three
      pitches. As with time shifting, pitches near the end of the pattern will
      need to be “wrapped around” to the beginning of the new pattern, and vice
      versa when shifting to the left.
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-7.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="s7">More Ways to Use the Transformations</p>
    <p>
      Note that in all of these examples, the transformed version occurs
      immediately after the original. But of course, you could also treat the
      transformed version as an entirely separate, isolated pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, you could also overlap the transformation with the original to
      create a more complex pattern:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-8.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Or you could even superimpose them completely to create harmony:</p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              src="/images/chapters/28-creating-variation-3-note-transformations/image-9.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
