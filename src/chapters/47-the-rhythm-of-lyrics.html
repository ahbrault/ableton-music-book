    <h1>The Rhythm of Lyrics</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      Your vocal melodies feel wrong somehow, as if there’s a “conflict” between
      the rhythm of the melody and the natural flow of the lyrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing vocal parts is a fundamentally more complicated problem than
      writing instrumental music because words and sentences have their own
      implicit rhythm that needs to be consciously considered. Here are some
      tips for understanding how to get your musical and textual rhythms to work
      together (or to counter each other, if that’s your intention).
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p class="s12">
      Scansion
      <span class="p"
        >is the study of a text’s inherent rhythm and the marking of each
        syllable in the text as being either strongly or weakly </span
      >stressed<span class="p"
        >. We use these stress patterns naturally and unconsciously when
        speaking and, unless we’re poets, probably never need to give them much
        thought outside of a musical context.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example: Let’s pretend this sentence is a lyric in your song. (Note:
      Artistically, this is probably not a good idea.) When you read it out
      loud, you will naturally apply a stress or “accent” to some syllables,
      while others will be spoken more softly. We’ll mark the strong syllables
      with a / and the weak ones with a *. (By convention, these stress markings
      are placed over the first vowel in the syllable.):
    </p>

    <p class="s37"><b>/ * / * / * / * / * / * /</b></p>
    <p class="s38">
      <b>Let’s pretend this sentence is a lyric in your song.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Applying these markings can sometimes be subjective. For example, it could
      be argued that “is” is weakly stressed (although it is probably stressed
      slightly more than the “a” that follows it). But now that we
    </p>
    <p>
      have a general sense of the inherent stress patterns of the text, we can
      relate this directly to the inherent stress patterns of musical beats. A
      couple of general (but by no means universal) rules:
    </p>
    <ul id="l30">
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          (Assuming a 4/4 meter), the first and third beats are considered
          “strong” or “on” beats while the second and fourth are considered
          “weak” or “off” beats.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          As you subdivide beats into shorter note values such as eighths and
          sixteenths, the same rule applies. That is, the odd-numbered
          subdivisions are perceived as stronger than the even-numbered ones.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Placing strong syllables on strong beats and weak syllables on weak beats
      usually results in a fairly natural-sounding vocal melody, while doing the
      opposite can often sound forced or stilted. Additionally, you can
      reinforce these natural alignments further by making stressed syllables
      louder, higher in pitch, or longer in duration.
    </p>
    <p>Here’s an example of a possible melody for this lyric:</p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="509"
              height="194"
              src="/images/chapters/47-the-rhythm-of-lyrics/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      It’s boring, but it “works” according to the scansion rules discussed
      earlier. Natural text accents occur on strong beat positions and are
      further emphasized by occurring on notes that last longer, while weakly
      stressed syllables occur on weak beats and have short durations.
    </p>
    <p>
      To contrast, let’s take a look at a possible melody that goes against the
      natural stresses of the lyric:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="509"
              height="191"
              src="/images/chapters/47-the-rhythm-of-lyrics/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      This is nearly identical to the first melody, but with an additional note
      added on beat two of the first bar in order to shift each syllable to the
      left. Now we’re breaking all the rules. The weakly stressed syllables
      happen almost entirely on strong beats and are sustained for long note
      durations, while the strongly accented syllables are short and on weak
      beats. This would be both difficult to sing and uncomfortable to listen
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although good vocal melodies are often significantly more nuanced and
      rhythmically intricate than both of these examples, you’ll find that most
      of the time, good melodies follow the natural patterns of stress in the
      lyrics. Of course, there are exceptions. A lot of contemporary hip-hop,
      for example, uses syncopation and unusual stress patterns to go against
      the rhythm of the text. And it’s always possible to apply more than one
      syllable of text to a single sustained note or, conversely, sustain a
      single syllable of text across more than a single pitch. But these are
      conscious and genre-specific musical decisions. If you find that your own
      vocal writing tends to feel strained and unnatural, it might be because
      you’re fighting against how the lyrics want to flow.
