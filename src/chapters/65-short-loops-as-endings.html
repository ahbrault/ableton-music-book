<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Finishing</em></p>
<h1>Short Loops as Endings</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You have an arrangement that’s almost, but not quite, finished. The form makes
  sense, and the pacing, tension, and release all seem to be working. The only
  problem is that there seems to be no way to actually end it. What can you do
  to close off the final section when it seems like it could just go on forever?
</p>
<p>
  A common problem when working on the late stages of a track is figuring out
  how to actually make it come to a real conclusion. A repeating chord
  progression in the closing phrase of a track, for example, may simply feel
  “right” if extended indefinitely. Leaving a loop playing continuously is,
  after all, a common way to work during the production phase of a track, and
  it’s sometimes difficult to exit the producer mindset and enter the world of
  the listener, who (naturally)
</p>
<p>
  expects a track to end at some point. If you simply stop the music, then the
  ending feels abrupt and rushed. But if you go on too long, you risk ruining
  the pacing and balance of an otherwise well-made track. Here’s a suggestion
  for bringing a track to a real, and satisfying, ending.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  One interesting way to end a track is to isolate a loop from somewhere in the
  song (the closing phrase usually works well) that is somewhat shorter than the
  phrase itself, and then repeat this loop a set number of times as a final
  musical gesture. For example, if the last passage of material in your song is
  an eight-bar chord progression, try isolating
</p>
<p>
  a one- or two-bar sub-passage within this material as a closing statement. For
  the listener, this material will already sound familiar, since it has been
  previously established in the closing phrase. But by using a short snippet
  instead of the full passage, we can create the illusion of speeding up, or a
  sudden increase in forward motion that drives towards the ending.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you may want to further reduce the size of the loop to continue
  this sense of acceleration into the ending. For example, our original
  eight-bar loop might first become two bars. Then after
</p>
<p>
  repeating this two bars for a little while, we might again reduce the two bars
  to one bar (or shorter). You will probably start to sense a natural ending
  point after repeating these shortened phrases a few times. If you still don’t
  hear an obvious ending, try simply stopping the music after a fixed, even
  number of shortened repetitions (say 4, 8, or 16). Via trial and error, you
  can often come up with an ending that works.

    >To add even more drive to the ending, you could try adding some Unique
    Events (page </a

  of activity as well as the textural density, while also breaking up the
  “purity” of the loops.
