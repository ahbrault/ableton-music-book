<h1>Personal Workflow</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  The more you read about music production techniques, the more you get the
  sense that you’re doing everything wrong. For example, some tutorials advocate
  working on sound design, composition, arranging, and mixing in that order and
  as entirely separate processes. Others recommend doing them all at the same
  time and working each section of the song to completion in all aspects before
  moving to a different part of the song. But none of these solutions feels
  quite right, and now you’re more confused and discouraged than you were before
  you read anything. What is <i>really </i>the optimum workflow?
</p>
<p>
  Reading multiple tutorials or books about music production can make you feel
  suspicious that it’s all just subjective. There seems to be so much
  disagreement from one source to the next that it all feels somewhat arbitrary.
  Who has the right answers?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  When it comes to optimal workflow, there is no objective right answer. The
  only way you can find a workflow that’s optimal for you is by trying out
  various methods, keeping the parts that work, rejecting the parts that don’t,
  and synthesizing your own solution out of what remains.
</p>
<p>
  When you’re reading a tutorial, you’re really reading about a workflow that
  has worked for that particular writer. A different writer may have had an
  entirely different experience, and so will have advocated an entirely
  different approach.
</p>
<p>
  If you have trouble getting music done, it’s worth looking at the workflows
  that other people advocate and giving them a try. But don’t expect that any
  one person’s approach will yield better results for your particular case than
  an approach that you develop yourself. It’s true that when trying out another
  method you may see a dramatic shift in your productivity (either positively or
  negatively). If things are better, then it’s likely you’ve found a direction
  that’s better than the one you were on before. If things are worse, you should
  probably abandon this direction and try something else. But in the end, even
  the best third-party workflow will benefit from your own personal tweaks and
  modifications.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have the sense that you’re going in the right direction, the key to
  optimizing your personal workflow is to practice it until it becomes a habit.
  Practice the steps just as you would practice an instrument, refining and
  adjusting as you go. Eventually, the workflow will stop being work and just
  become flow—the things you do unconsciously while creating.
</p>
<p>
  This all sounds quite abstract, but there really aren’t so many possible
  things to consider. At a fundamental level, music production workflows all
  involve answers to the following questions:
</p>
<ul id="l14">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>What are the things I need to do?</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>Is there an order I should do them in? If so, what is it?</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>When should I move on to the next thing?</p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>When do I know I’m completely done?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you understand how to answer these questions—for yourself, not as
  absolutes—you will have developed your personal workflow. All that’s left to
  do is make music with it.
