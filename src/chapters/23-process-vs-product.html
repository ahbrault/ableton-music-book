<h1>Process vs. Product</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Often we read interviews with interesting musicians in which they talk about
  the monumental effort that goes into their creative work. Similarly, they may
  talk about how their music is rigorously structured or adheres to particular
  types of architectural processes that are carefully and painstakingly planned
  and then require immense work to carry out. When we then go to work on our own
  music, it may feel like we’re “under thinking” or not investing enough effort.
  We may begin work but then stop and second- guess what we’ve made if we don’t
  feel like we’ve done enough preparation to allow us to really begin
  “properly.”
</p>
<p>
  The idea of “process” in music refers to the development of a system or set of
  rules that allows some or all of the elements of the music to be generated or
  derived without requiring the composer to make purely intuitive creative
  decisions at every possible moment. There is a belief in our culture, often
  reinforced by interviews with celebrities, that there is a necessary and
  direct correlation between process and quality. For musicians who work
  intuitively, or via improvisation and experiment, this narrative can be
  intimidating. How can it be possible to create great work if we don’t have a
  grand scheme and/or long hours of struggle?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  First, take every interview with a grain of salt. Interviews allow artists to
  share insights into their working methods, but interviews can also serve a
  valuable self-promotional function. There is nothing wrong with this—artists
  should take advantage of opportunities to present themselves. But readers
  should not expect an interview to reveal absolute truths, and stories about
  struggles, hard work, and rigorous planning might simply serve to help an
  artist create and publicly project a romantic or idealized self-image.
</p>
<p>
  Second, effort, rigor, pre-planning, and structure are not prerequisites for
  quality results. They may help you get there, but they are neither necessary
  to begin work nor, in themselves, evidence for quality. It’s tempting to
  believe that things we’ve spent a lot of time and energy on are worth it, but
  in the case of music, only the results matter.
</p>
<p>
  Some listeners may indeed actively listen for musical structure, and the
  intricacy, depth, or cohesiveness of that structure may be what determines for
  them whether or not the music is “good.” Likewise, some listeners may enjoy
  music because it sounds “difficult.” Consider, for example, certain types of
  virtuosic metal or progressive rock, in which technical ability is a
  prerequisite. But there is no universal relationship between artistic effort
  and artistic quality. Many listeners take in music on a much more immediate
  and visceral level and enjoy particular music for reasons which may be more
  difficult to quantify.
</p>
<p>
  Think of the process of creation as something like the scaffolding on a
  building. It’s placed there to help the builders navigate the unsteadiness of
  a fragile work in progress. But once the building is completed, the
  scaffolding is removed and promptly forgotten. It is not, in itself, the thing
  being made. It may have curiosity value to other builders, who may have an
  abstract interest in the artifacts of construction. But good scaffolding
  cannot guarantee a good building any more than a good working process can
  guarantee a good song.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, there is the danger that too much time invested in planning how
  you’ll work will both prevent you from actually working <i>and </i>cause you
  to accept results that sound bad just because they fit the plan. For example,
  imagine you’ve spent hours crafting a four- minute song in which the second
  two minutes are a literal mirror image of the first two. This is an
  interesting idea in the abstract. It provides a path forward: Once you’ve
  finished two minutes of music, you now have a system for how to finish two
  more through the simple application of a formula. But is it a good idea? Only
  the results can determine this. At the end, the product—not the process—is
  what you’re left with, and the product needs to be strong enough to survive on
  its own.
</p>
<p>
  This is not to suggest that you shouldn’t experiment with employing processes
  in your music. Maybe a song with a mirrored form really will end up being
  amazing. And even if it isn’t, you may end up learning something about how
  mirroring works as a musical process that can be applied in different ways in
  future works. What’s important is that you don’t fall so in love with the idea
  of what your music should be (or the work that you’ve put into it) that you
  fail to honestly judge it on the basis of how it really sounds when you’ve
  finished. Better yet:
</p>
<p>
  Listen critically at every stage of the process, and be willing to abandon
  conceptual directions if they are leading to bad musical results.
</p>
<p>
  There is a rich history of brilliant music made by musicians who started
  without a grand scheme and simply followed where their experiments or
  improvisations led them. Furthermore, there is an equally rich tradition of
  brilliant music that was made very quickly and with seemingly little effort.
  Again, the important thing is the song—the final result of the work. What’s
  unimportant (or, more accurately, what’s not a reliable predictor of quality)
  is everything leading up to that point: the sketches and careful planning
  diagrams, the months spent in the studio, etc.
</p>

<p>
  If those things really are the way that you get to a great result, then you
  should absolutely do them. But do not convince yourself that those things will
  guarantee a great result.
