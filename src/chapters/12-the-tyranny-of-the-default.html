<h1>The Tyranny of the Default</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s26">
  Every time you’re inspired to start a new song, you open your DAW and are
  immediately terrified by the blank project. Maybe you have a simple melody,
  bass line, or drum part in your head. But in order to hear it, you first have
  to load the appropriate instruments, set the tempo, maybe connect a MIDI
  controller, etc. By the time you’ve gotten your DAW to a state where you can
  actually record, you’ve either lost the motivation or you’ve forgotten your
  original musical idea.
</p>
<p>
  Because DAWs have to cater to a wide range of users, they are often designed
  to work out of the box with a collection of default options and a basic screen
  layout that will be offensive to no one but probably also not optimal for
  anyone. This inevitably leads to a phenomenon that software developers call
  “the tyranny of the default”: Since most users will never change their default
  software options, the seemingly small decisions made by developers may have a
  profound effect on the way users will experience the software every day.
</p>
<p>Here’s how to overcome the tyranny of the default in your own studio.</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Rather than allowing your DAW to dictate the environment in which you’ll start
  each track, take the time to build your own default or template project.
  People often think of templates as blank slates containing a bare minimum of
  elements, and most default templates provided by DAWs are exactly that; maybe
  one or two empty tracks, perhaps a return track containing a single effect.
  But if you regularly start work in a similar way (and even if you don’t),
  building a template that’s unique to your musical preferences and working
  style can save you lots of time when you start a new song, allowing you to
  more quickly capture an initial musical idea from your head into your DAW.

    >For example, many DAWs set a default tempo of 120 bpm for new projects. If
    you tend to work in a genre that is generally in a different range of tempos
    (see Choosing a Tempo (page </a
  >41)), save yourself time by saving your template with a more appropriate
  tempo. Additionally, your DAW’s default project likely makes a lot of
  assumptions about how many output channels you’ll be using (usually two), as
  well as more esoteric settings like sample rate, bit depth, and even the
  interface’s color scheme. If you prefer different settings, don’t change them
  every time you start a new song. Instead, make these changes once and save
  them in your own template.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, if you regularly use a particular collection of instruments
  and/or effects, try pre-loading them into tracks in your DAW and saving them
  into your template. If you have a go-to sound that you use for sketching out
  ideas (maybe a sampled piano or a particular preset), preload that preset in
  your template and even arm the track for recording. This way you can be ready
  to play and record as soon as the project is loaded.
</p>
<p>
  Some DAWs even allow you to create templates for different types of tracks.
  For example, if you regularly use a particular combination of effects on each
  track (such as a compressor and EQ), you could preload these devices—and even
  customize their parameters—into your default tracks. Then each time you create
  a new track in any project, you’ll have these effects in place without needing
  to search through your library of devices.
</p>
<p>
  If you regularly work in a variety of genres, you should consider making
  multiple templates, each one customized for the different sounds and working
  methods you prefer. Even if your DAW doesn’t natively support multiple
  templates, you can still create your own collection; you’ll just need to
  remember to Save As as soon as you load one, so you don’t accidentally
  overwrite it.
</p>
<p>
  Some producers, recognizing the value of a highly customized template project,
  have even started selling templates containing nearly (or even completely)
  finished songs, with the stated goal that newer producers can use these to
  learn the production techniques of the pros. If that’s really how you intend
  to use them, then these are a potentially valuable learning resource. But be
  careful to avoid just using these as “construction kits” for your own music.
  This is potentially worse than working from an empty default and is a gray
  area between original music and paint-by-numbers copying (or worse, outright
  plagiarism).
