<h1>Formal Skeletons</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You have all of the elements you’ll need for a great song, but it seems that
  no matter how you put them together, the arrangement feels unsatisfying. When
  you listen to your favorite tracks, you never have this feeling; every part
  seems to last just the right amount of time, tension and release are balanced
  perfectly, and the song just “works” exactly as it should.
</p>
<p>
  Creating successful arrangements requires having a great internal sense of
  proportion, an understanding of how long each song section needs to be in
  relation to the others. Luckily, this is a skill that can be learned, and one
  of the best ways to learn it is by studying and copying from great examples
  that already exist.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Find a song that has a form that works and that’s somehow in the same musical
  universe as the music you’re writing. Then load that song into an empty
  project in your DAW, starting from the left edge (bar 1). Carefully adjust the
  tempo of your project so that it perfectly matches the tempo of the song
  you’ve loaded. This ensures that your DAW’s beat grid will align perfectly
  with the actual beats in the song.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have this set up, carefully listen to the song. When you hear a
  formal division (or even an interesting moment within a formal section), stop
  playback and place a marker at that point. Then continue listening from that
  point until you reach the next formal division, at which point you’ll stop and
  add another marker. Continue this process until you reach the end of the song.
  If your DAW allows this, give the markers descriptive or functional names that
  will help you to understand the musical significance of the marker without
  having to listen again. If the song is in a genre that uses conventional song
  structures, you might give these markers names like “Verse,” “Chorus,” etc. If
  not, you can simply give yourself clues like “Bass starts.” Here’s how a song
  might look when you’ve finished this process:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="505" height="85" src="/images/chapters/62-formal-skeletons/image-1.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  As with the above example, in most electronic genres, you’ll probably find
  that these formal divisions will occur at multiples of four or eight bars.
  This is by no means universal, but it can be a handy reference when working on
  your own arrangements—either by nature or because it simply occurs in so much
  music, listeners seem to be primed to expect formal divisions at these points.
</p>

<p>
  Now you can simply delete the original audio file, leaving the markers behind
  as a kind of skeletal outline of an arrangement that you know is effective:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="504" height="85" src="/images/chapters/62-formal-skeletons/image-2.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  From here, you can arrange your song to fill in this formal outline. And
  because your materials are your own, there’s little chance that you’ll end up
  duplicating the song you’ve used as a reference.
</p>
<p>
  ~ Note: As with all of the ideas in this book, once you actually start
  employing this in practice, you may find that your own musical materials don’t
  naturally fit into the arrangement skeleton perfectly. Maybe your breakdown
  section “wants” to be four bars longer, for example. In these cases, you must
  absolutely trust your instincts.
</p>
<p>
  The formal skeleton should be used to get you started, but you should
  absolutely feel free to move parts around once you’re actually in the flow.
