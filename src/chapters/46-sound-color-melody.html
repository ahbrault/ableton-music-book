<h1>Sound-Color Melody</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You can write a strong, memorable melody. But especially at slow tempos, even
  if the notes and rhythms are right, you regularly get bored with the sound.
  You’ve tried programming parameter automation so that the timbre changes over
  time, but you still have the sense that the sound is too static.
</p>
<p>
  Long, slow melodies are difficult to write effectively in electronic music. By
  default, synthesizer sounds don’t tend to vary much from note to note, and
  even with careful use of modulation or automation to create a dynamic,
  changing sound, there can still be a sense that the timbre of the melody isn’t
  “breathing” or is too artificial sounding. Here is a technique you can use to
  create more timbral variation, particularly in slow melodies.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  The German word <i>Klangfarbenmelodie </i>(“sound-color melody”) refers to the
  distribution of a melody (or even a single pitch) between multiple
  instruments. This is a similar concept to hocket (see Linear Rhythm
  <a href="#bookmark145" class="a">in Melodies (page </a>190)), although hocket
  generally refers to rapid, rhythmic transfer of melodic notes between voices
  at a fast tempo, while Klangfarbenmelodie is often slower and more subtle—one
  melodic voice gradually fading out as another fades in, for example.
</p>
<p>
  Klangfarbenmelodie was originally developed as a technique for creating
  timbral variety in instrumental melodies, although it’s perhaps even better
  suited for electronic music. For example, let’s begin with the four-bar melody
  below:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="514" height="230" src="/images/chapters/46-sound-color-melody/image-1.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The conventional way to treat a melody like this would be to have it play on a
  track that triggered a software or hardware instrument.
</p>
<p>
  For a richer sound, perhaps multiple instruments could be layered or stacked.
  But another approach might be to split the higher-pitched notes from the
  lower-pitched ones, and route the two halves through different instruments.
  This particular melody is well-suited to this kind of treatment because of its
  “wedge-like” distribution of pitches. For example, we might arbitrarily decide
  that the high voice will play E3 and above, while the low voice plays
  everything below E3. Many DAWs allow for creating “split points” or “zones”
  within a single MIDI track, which take care of the MIDI routing automatically.
  In these cases, you can simply assign the split points as desired, load the
  two instruments onto the same track, and play the clip. If your DAW doesn’t
  support this functionality, you could duplicate the track, modify or replace
  the second track’s instrument, and then delete notes as necessary from each
  pattern so that the melody is divided between them in an interesting and
  musical way.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike hocketing, where abrupt, jagged timbral changes are the intended
  musical result, the idea with Klangfarbenmelodie is to create a smooth,
  seamless exchange between voices. In the example melody discussed previously,
  another possibility might be to duplicate the track (or layer multiple
  instruments on a single track) but then use instruments that have “mirrored”
  volume envelopes. For example, one instrument might have a fast attack and a
  gradual decay, while the second instrument might have a slow attack. In this
  situation, the first instrument would supply the initial onset of the note,
  while the second instrument would fade in as the first faded away. Obviously,
  this requires carefully tuning the respective envelopes so that they make
  sense in the context of both the song’s tempo and the duration of the notes in
  the pattern. But when configured properly, the result can be a slow timbral
  shift across the duration of each note.

  These examples illustrate some possibilities with Klangfarbenmelodie across
  two voices, but even more possibilities become available when you use three or
  more voices.
