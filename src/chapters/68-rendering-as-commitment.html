<em hidden="true">Part: ‌Problems of Finishing</em>
<h1>Rendering as Commitment</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re nearly finished with the song. The arrangement is perfect, the mix is
  coming together, and you expect that you’re just a few minor tweaks away from
  something you’ll be really happy with. But then you start thinking “what if I
  could make these sounds even better?” So you go back to your synths and start
  tweaking knobs. One change leads to another, which leads to additional sound
  design work on another track, and now hours have passed and you’re no closer
  to done—in fact, you feel like you’ve gone backwards, and you’re just
  programming kick drum sounds again, like you were at the very beginning of
  your work on the track.
</p>
<p>
  This scenario is especially common for people who work entirely in software.
  With total recall of every setting possible just by loading the project, we’re
  able to easily go back and rework even the tiniest details of both the music
  and the sounds, regardless of what stage of the process we’re at. In fact,
  there isn’t even really a need to think in terms of “stages” anymore; we can
  seamlessly move between sound design, composition, arranging, and mixing right
  until the point at which we export the final file.
</p>
<p>
  But this kind of flexibility can actually be a detriment to our real goal,
  which is getting music done.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  If you find that your desire to tweak the low-level details gets in the way of
  your ability to finish, consider adopting a workflow that simply takes away
  your ability to tweak. One way to do this is by rendering to audio much
  earlier in the process than you normally would.
</p>
<p>
  Although modern DAWs blur the line between editing MIDI and audio, there is
  still a huge range of latent possibility (and thus distraction) available just
  by having access to the source instruments. By rendering to audio—and then
  removing the instruments that made it—you’re forced to change your mode of
  interaction with your material. You can’t change patches anymore, or adjust
  parameters. This forces at least
  <a href="#bookmark89" class="a"
    >the “programming synthesizers” part of the sound design process to come to
    an end. By closing certain doors behind you, the only way you can move is
    forward—writing, arranging, and mixing the song. This is essentially an
    Arbitrary Constraint (page </a
  >33) self-imposed for the sole purpose of eliminating possibilities.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, if you’re collaborating with other people, rendering to audio
  streamlines project portability. It’s no longer necessary for you and your
  collaborators to have exactly the same plug-ins, and you can be sure that
  shared files will open correctly on any machine. And this could also allow you
  to more explicitly divide up the collaborative responsibilities. For example,
  one of you could be entirely responsible for sound design and idea creation
  while the other handles arranging and mixing. By working only with rendered
  audio, the second person is forced to focus more on their specific roles and
  is unable to easily dip back into the sound design mindset.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, if you’re working with plug-in instruments rather than hardware ones,
  an additional side benefit of rendering early is that it significantly reduces
  your DAW’s processing requirements. Working with audio is much less
  resource-intensive than working with virtual instruments, and constantly
  having to deal with an overloaded machine can itself be a damper on
  creativity, so working this way helps to solve this problem almost by
  accident.
</p>

<p>
  And of course, this technique applies to more than just instruments. Including
  the sound of effects processing in your “early” audio renderings can be an
  even more extreme level of commitment. It may also help you to find new
  creative uses of effects, because you can be more free to capture the sound of
  a particular moment of processing experiments, rather than thinking of effects
  as locked to particular tracks. For example, you could work with an effect for
  a while, render the audio of its output, delete the effect, replace it with
  another one, and repeat.
</p>
<p>
  If you own multiple DAWs, you could even consider switching between them for
  different stages of the production process, and rendering to audio becomes a
  necessary step in this case. For example, maybe you use one DAW for sound
  design, because you prefer the sound of some of its native instruments or
  effects. But you prefer another DAW for mixing because you like the look of
  its metering.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re really worried that rendering is too much of a commitment, but you
  still want to take advantage of the workflow benefits that rendering provides,
  you could try the intermediate step of saving multiple versions of your
  project, both pre- and post-rendering. This way, you can choose to work with
  the audio-only version but still go back to the older version containing the
  original instruments if there’s a low-level change that you really need to
  make. The risk of working this way, however, is that any edits you make to one
  version will need to also be made to the other in order to keep them in sync.
