<h1>Humanizing With Automation Envelopes</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  When live musicians play instruments, there are subtle, constant variations in
  the tuning and length of notes that help to create the sense that the music is
  “alive.” How can you recreate this effect in electronic music?
</p>
<p>
  On most traditional instruments, all or most of the stages of the amplitude
  envelope are entirely under the control of the performer. And on some
  instruments (such as woodwinds, brass instruments, and stringed instruments
  without frets), the player also controls the tuning of each note. But most
  electronic instruments use an envelope generator to determine the amplitude
  characteristics of the sound, and use conventional equal-tempered tuning to
  determine pitch.
</p>
<p>
  This makes these instruments predictable and easy to play, but at the expense
  of some of the subtlety and expression that gives non- electronic music its
  human character. Here are some ideas about how to use your DAW’s automation
  envelopes to provide some humanization to any electronic instrument.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Most of the time, synthesizer programming involves setting the parameter
  values that define the sound and then mostly leaving them alone. Many
  producers will employ some automation to give the sound a sense of motion, but
  this is often applied to just a few controls—filter cutoff and maybe
  resonance. But by applying even subtle automation to a few more parameters,
  you can create much richer and more organic sounds.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than treating amplitude envelope parameters as static values, try
  employing automation to change these values over the course of a phrase or
  even over your whole arrangement. In particular, by varying the attack and
  decay times, you can create subtle changes in the perceived duration of notes.
  In most cases, the actual parameter values used won’t really matter much. This
  means you might also be able to achieve a similar effect by using parameter
  randomization tools (if your DAW provides them) rather than needing to create
  long automation envelopes. But even if you do choose to use automation, you’ll
  likely find that this is substantially less work than editing the durations of
  individual MIDI notes.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, try using automation to create small variations in the overall
  tuning of the synth. It’s critical that these changes be
  <i>extremely </i>small. The goal is to simulate the kinds of human intonation
  “errors” that give live instruments character, but tuning shifts of more than
  a few cents in either direction are likely to simply sound out of tune. And as
  with amplitude envelopes, the actual tuning values probably won’t really
  matter, which means that you might be able to get the same effect via
  randomization.
</p>
<p>
  By applying subtle automation or randomization to envelope and pitch
  parameters, you can emulate a lot of the subtle characteristics that make live
  instruments sound so organic. But there’s no reason to stop with only these
  parameters. Modern synthesizers, samplers, and effects often have a huge
  number of adjustable parameters, many of which are either ignored outright or
  are set once per sound and then forgotten. Try experimenting with subtle
  automation changes to any of these parameters as well. You may find that the
  results sound artificial and strange, but it’s possible that this is exactly
  the character your music needs.
