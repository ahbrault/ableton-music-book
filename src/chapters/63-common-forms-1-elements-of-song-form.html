<h1>Common Forms 1: Elements of Song Form</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You have no problem creating musical ideas, but you find it difficult to
  organize those ideas into an arrangement that makes sense. You’ve heard terms
  like “verse,” “chorus,” and “bridge” to describe the sections of some songs,
  but you’re never quite sure what these words really mean or whether or not
  they’re relevant to your own musical work.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding the various types of commonly used song sections can help your
  understanding of the music you hear, as well as provide options for the music
  you write. Here’s more information about what these sections are, how they
  work, and how they relate to each other.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Across many different genres, there are a handful of terms that are commonly
  used to refer to the various sections of a song. Much music, especially in
  genres that are related to pop music, is structured by combining these
  standard section types in a variety of ways. The most common sections are:
</p>
<h4>
  Verse or “A” Section<span class="p"
    >: A song’s verse is generally a recurring section— usually 16 or 32 bars in
    length—that serves as the main body of the song. In music with lyrics, the
    verse often tells the “story.”</span
  >
</h4>
<h4>
  Chorus or “B” Section<span class="p"
    >: The chorus is usually also recurring, and of comparable length to the
    verse. It acts as a contrast to the material of the verse and usually
    contains the “hook” of the song—a melodic idea that is intended to stick in
    the listener’s head. Often, the chorus serves as a point of musical
    resolution, while the verse creates musical tension. Another important
    distinction between verse and chorus: Recurring verses share the same music
    but they generally have different lyrics, while recurring choruses most
    often share both music and lyrics. Additionally, in music with lyrics, the
    chorus often contains the title of the song. As a general rule, the first
    chorus in a song occurs after a verse (although there are some songs that
    begin with a chorus).</span

</h4>
<h4>
  Bridge or “C” Section<span class="p"
    >: The bridge serves as a contrast to both the verse and chorus and
    typically occurs only once in a song. Musically, bridges are often
    substantially different from the rest of the music</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  in the song; they may be in a different key, employ unusual chord
  progressions, or have a dramatically different level of textural density and
  energy. In some types of music, the bridge is used for instrumental solos.
  Generally, the bridge occurs only after at least one verse and one chorus.

    >The A, B, and C letter names are often used to create formal diagrams of
    particular songs, and this can be a useful tool in your own Active Listening
    (page </a
  ><a href="#bookmark81" class="a"
    >22) or when writing a Catalog of Attributes (page </a
  >16). For example, one common form in commercial music is <b>ABABCB</b> or
  <b>Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus</b>. In some songs that use this
  basic form, there may be one or more additional choruses added to the end. But
  otherwise, this form is used unchanged in probably the majority of
  contemporary pop songs you’ll hear on the radio. “Royals” by Lorde is an
  example of ABABCB form followed exactly.

    >Although there is a wide variety of possible song forms that can be made
    just from various combinations of verse, chorus, and bridge, these types of
    sectional constructions are less commonly used in more underground or
    experimental music. For example, most contemporary electronic genres without
    vocals tend to avoid conventional verse and chorus sections, and instead
    create formal contrast via addition and subtraction of layers (see Common
    Forms 2: Layering as Form (page </a
  >272)). But if you’re working in genres more closely related to pop music, you
  can create a lot of music using only these few section types.
