<h1>Creating Harmony 1: The Basics</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You don’t know enough about how chords really “work” to understand how to get
  from one chord to another, and your attempts to create interesting chord
  progressions never match up to the music that inspires you.
</p>
<p>
  Harmony is a big topic, and covering the full range of how chords work is
  beyond the scope of this book. But fortunately, the vast majority of what’s
  commonly done with harmony in many types of music can be learned with just a
  bit of background and some basic terms. Here are some of the fundamentals.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Most music is considered to be in a particular <i>key</i><a href="#bookmark157" class="a">. If we say that a song is “in C,” this simply means that the note C sounds
    to most listeners like the most stable “home note” for the song. Key can be
    established in a few ways: either through Repetition and Insistence (page </a><a href="#bookmark157">236)</a> or, more commonly, through the use of chord
  combinations that sound, to most listeners, like they want to
  <i>resolve </i>back to the home note. This sense of tension and resolution is
  the basis of most successful chord progressions.
</p>
<p>
  If we continue to assume C is our key note (or <i>tonic</i>), we can then
  determine the other notes in the <i>scale </i>of the key. The two most common
  <i>qualities </i>of scales are <i>major </i>and <i>minor</i>. These terms
  refer to the particular pattern of note distances (or <i>intervals</i>)
  between the adjacent notes in the scale. The C Major scale contains the
  following notes (shown in both a MIDI piano roll and conventional notation):

<p>
  Although the examples in this chapter all use C as the tonic, you can easily
  transpose the examples in your DAW to try them out in any other key. Every
  major scale, regardless of starting note, contains seven notes (before
  repeating the first note again) and the same pattern of intervals between
  notes. That pattern is a particular combination of half steps (two immediately
  adjacent notes on the piano keyboard) and whole steps (notes that are two half
  steps apart): <b>Whole - Whole - Half</b>

<h4>- Whole - Whole - Whole - Half<span class="p">:</span></h4>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The minor scale contains a slightly different pattern of half and whole steps:
  <b>Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole</b>:

  ~ Note: Most DAWs use either only sharps or only flats in the piano roll. For
  our purposes here, consider D<span class="s18"># </span>= E<span class="s18">b</span>, G<span class="s18"># </span>= A<span class="s18">b</span>, and A<span class="s18"># </span>= B<span class="s18">b</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Now that we’ve established how major and minor scales are made, we can build
  chords on each of the notes in the scale. The most common chords are triads,
  which are built by adding the <i>third </i>and <i>fifth </i>notes above a
  starting note (or root). For example, in C Major, the triad built on C
  contains C (the root), E (the third note above C), and G (the fifth note above
  C). The triad built on A contains A (the root), C (the third note above A) and
  E (the fifth note above A). Here are the seven triads in C Major:

    </tr>

<img src="/images/chapters/48-creating-harmony-1-the-basics/image-7.webp">

<p>
  We referred earlier to the terms major and minor as being the
  <i>quality </i>of the key or scale. The triads in a particular key also have
  major or minor quality and, as with scales, this is determined by the interval
  distances between the notes. Major triads have four half steps between the
  root and the third note, while minor triads have only three. In both major and
  minor triads, there are seven half steps between the root and the fifth note.
  With this information, we can analyze and determine the quality of each triad
  in a particular key, simply by counting semitones.
</p>

<p>
  Rather than using specific chord names (such as “C Major”), we can use Roman
  numerals for this type of chord analysis. This helps to emphasize an important
  aspect of this theory: Everything discussed here is completely transposable to
  any key, and all of the harmonic and scale relationships work exactly the same
  way regardless of which specific note is our tonic. By convention, major
  triads are labeled with capitalized Roman numerals, while minor triads are
  written with lower case Roman numerals. Here are the labels for the triads in
  the C Major scale:

<p>And the triads in the C minor scale:</p>

<p>
  If you actually went through and measured the intervals in each of the triads
  above, you probably noticed that two of these chords don’t fit into either the
  major or minor pattern. The seven chord in the major scale and the two chord
  in the minor scale are of a different quality, called diminished. Diminished
  triads, like minor triads, have three half

  If you actually went through and measured the intervals in each of the triads
  above, you probably noticed that two of these chords don’t fit into either the
  major or minor pattern. The seven chord in the major scale and the two chord
  in the minor scale are of a different quality, called
  <i>diminished</i>. Diminished triads, like minor triads, have three half steps
  between the root and the third note. But they have only six half steps between
  the root and the fifth note (as opposed to seven for the minor triad).
  Diminished triads are labeled with the superscript<span class="s52">o</span><span class="s53"> </span>after the Roman numeral.

  It may sound surprising, but a huge amount of music, from the Classical period
  all the way to much contemporary pop and electronic music, uses
  <i>only </i>the seven chords that exist in a particular key (called the
  <i>diatonic </i>chords). And many songs use no more than two or three of these
  chords. But the choice and order of diatonic chords is what determines how the
  chord progression really sounds. What follows are a few general guidelines
  that can help you move from one chord to the next (Roman numerals refer to the
  major scale, but the patterns are similar for minor scales).
</p>
<p>
  After a I chord, anything is possible; all chords within the key sound equally
  appropriate after the tonic chord. The V or vii<span class="s52">o</span><span class="s53"> </span>chords sound (to most listeners) like they “want”
  to resolve back to I (although V can sometimes lead to vi). The ii and IV
  chords have a tendency to lead towards the V or vii<span class="s52">o</span><span class="s53"> </span>(although IV also commonly leads back to I or to
  its “partner” ii). The vi chord leads to the ii or IV. And finally, the iii
  chord has a tendency to be followed by the vi. This series of chord
  resolutions can be summarized in this figure:
</p>

<p>
  Using just these guidelines for diatonic triads, you have access to a huge
  number of usable chord progressions. For example, one of the most common
  progressions is I - V - vi - IV:

<p>
  This is the progression in the verses of Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek,” the
  choruses of Adele’s “Someone Like You,” and many more. In fact, there are
  <i>countless </i>well-known songs that use this exact progression (“Four Chord
  Song” by Axis of Awesome is an enlightening mashup of 36 of them).
</p>
<p>
  Chord progressions that follow these guidelines are said to be
  <i>functional </i>because each chord functions as a preparation for the next
  chord in the series. There is, of course, a much wider world of harmonic
  possibilities available beyond just using diatonic triads. But if you’re
  interested in creating music that’s within the realm of pop music, you can get
  quite far using only these seven chords.
</p>
<p>
  ~ Side note: A lot of the theory behind the construction of scales and triads
  may seem like arbitrary, rote memorization. Why did these particular
  combinations of whole and half steps come to define the scales that are
  commonly used? Why do certain chords have a feeling of “wanting” to move to
  other chords? Why do these scales and chords exist at all? Detailed answers
  are beyond the scope of this book but largely have to do with acoustics: The
  intervals of the major scale can be derived from fairly simple whole number
  frequency ratios that correspond to the overtone series. But perhaps even more
  importantly, much of this theory is <i>descriptive </i>rather than
  <i>prescriptive</i>: The theory was developed to help explain patterns in
  music that already existed, rather than to tell composers what they should or
  should not do in the future.
