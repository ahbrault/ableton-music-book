    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You regularly notice that your rate of progress gets slower and slower as
      you get closer to the end of the song. The beginning creation phase is
      very fast, and this always feels inspiring. But endings seem to take
      forever.
    </p>
    <p class="s16">
      You’re constantly going back to refine, never quite sure that things are
      as good as they can be. As a result, you get increasingly discouraged as
      time goes on, and the final stages of work on a song are the most time-
      consuming and painful.
    </p>

      Most producers are perfectionists. We want our tracks to be better than
      the ones that inspire us, and at least as good as some abstract ideal that
      we have in the back of our mind for what our music should be. But in
      reality, perfection is unattainable, and continuing to tinker with a song
      in the very late stages may actually make things worse.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      As difficult as it might feel in the moment, it’s important to learn to
      recognize the point at which the song is “good enough.” This is not the
      point at which you can continue to make <i>real </i>improvements; if
      continuing to work is really making things better, then you should
      continue to work! Instead, this is the point at which continuing to work
      will yield meaningless or arbitrary results. Learning where this point is
      in the production process is different for everyone. But if you regularly
      find yourself endlessly tweaking what is essentially a finished mix,
      you’ve probably reached the point of diminishing returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the time, this late-stage tweaking is the result of a fear of
      commitment. Once we decide that the song is finished, we might be stricken
      with doubt: “If I had worked harder, would it have been
    </p>
    <p>
      better?” But it’s important to realize that, by this stage, you’ve
      probably already made all of the hard decisions that need to be made. At
      best, continuing to tweak will probably just waste time that could be
      better spent getting to work on the next track. In the worst case, you
      might actually go backwards and make the track worse. This is because your
      initial decisions often prove to be the right ones, and the more time you
      spend second-guessing yourself, the more likely you are to override your
      instincts in a negative way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it will take time and concentration, learn to find the point
      where the track isn’t going to benefit from further work, and train
      yourself to stop there. In the long run, you’ll finish more music without
      sacrificing quality.
