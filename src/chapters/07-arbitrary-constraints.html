<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Music production with a computer offers a limitless field of possibilities.
  Any sound can be made, manipulated, re-recorded, re-manipulated, etc. But
  while an infinite range of options might sound appealing, it also means that
  decision making is hard. The more options you see, the more you need to make
  active choices about which ones to pursue and which ones to ignore.
</p>
<p>
  Limiting the field of possibilities isn’t just about making it easier to work.
  It’s also about making it possible to begin at all. If every possible starting
  direction is equally appealing, how could you ever choose one?
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  Apply arbitrary constraints before starting to work. Create a “narrow frame”
  of possibilities, and then act entirely within that frame. Applying arbitrary
  constraints helps to limit your field of options, allowing you to move
  forward.
</p>
<p>
  It’s important to note that these constraints really are arbitrary; you’re
  attempting to eliminate <i>perfectly valid </i>options rather than
  <i>bad </i>ones. Bad options are easy to deal with; your own musical
  sensibilities will reject them automatically. But valid options need special
  care because their validity requires you to make active choices about whether
  to pursue or reject them. Eliminating them arbitrarily helps you avoid
  decision paralysis. Also, the fact that the constraints are arbitrary means
  that it doesn’t really matter if you’re wrong. If you realize during the
  course of your work that you’ve constrained yourself too much, or in the wrong
  direction, you can simply choose to remove the constraint.
</p>
<p>
  Here are a number of ideas for arbitrary constraints, both related to the
  music itself and also to working method:
</p>

<p class="s7">Musical Constraints</p>
<ul id="l8">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <h4>
      Make every sound from one sample.
      <span class="p"
        >An extreme restriction on available sound sources forces you to really
        think about the character and possibilities of the sounds you choose.
        Can you make a kick drum sample into a lush pad? How about a hi-hat?
        What kinds of processing could you use for these transformations?</span
      >
    </h4>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      <b>Completely avoid an instrument that would be expected in the genre. </b
      >For example, the untitled Peter Gabriel album commonly called
      <i>Melt </i>has no cymbals. Prince’s classic song “When Doves Cry” has no
      bass line. These kinds of restrictions force your decision making process
      into new directions. If an entire functional role is missing, how do you
      fill the gap? In the case of <i>Melt</i>, Gabriel had to find ways to
      propel time forward without relying on mainstays like hi-hats or ride
      cymbals. His solution was a range of unconventional percussion
      instruments. In the case of “When Doves Cry,” Prince chooses to leave the
      sonic space unfilled. Consider both options in your own work.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="s7">Constraints on Time</p>
<ul id="l9">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <h4>
      Give yourself a deadline.
      <span class="p">Nothing motivates like a due date.</span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Since work always expands to fill the available time, it’s necessary to
      actually put a limit on that time. If you find self-imposed deadlines to
      be too “soft,” try having someone else assign the deadline for you, with
      the requirement that you show them the work at the end to ensure
      accountability. Or engage in a collective challenge, such as February
      Album Writing Month.<span class="s21">*</span>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <h4>
      Schedule tasks as if they were appointments with yourself.
      <span class="p"
        >Try using a calendar to restrict specific types of work to specific
        times. For example:</span

  <a href="#bookmark103" class="a">Timeboxing </a>(page 65) specific tasks
  serves two purposes: It forces you to narrow your focus while simultaneously
  eliminating the risk of non-musical distractions (Facebook, etc.). You
  wouldn’t check your email in the middle of a business meeting, so treat these
  “appointments” with the same kind of care.

      Change your venue.
      <span class="p"
        >If you’re used to making music in a particular place, try moving to a
        different one. Simply moving from your bedroom studio to the local
        coffee shop forces your hand in a number of ways. First of all, you’re
        limited by what you can take with you—no racks of external hardware, for
        example. Secondly, you’re in an environment that is at least somewhat
        unfamiliar, so you’re unable to fully relax (and thus become
        distracted). Many musicians avoid having a home studio altogether,
        instead choosing to rent studio space so that they can separate their
        working mindset from their living mindset.</span

</ul>
<p>
  Although you may not realize it at first, you’re most likely already applying
  certain constraints to your work. For example, simply making the choice to
  work within a specific genre already eliminates a huge range of musical
  possibilities. To say that you’re working on a “house track” as opposed to a
  “Balkan folktronica track” implies that you understand certain general
  characteristics (the instrumentation, rhythms, and harmonic language that
  identify a given piece of music as being “in” a particular genre) that
  describe one music as opposed to another.
