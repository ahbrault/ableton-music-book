<p><em>Part: ‌Problems of Beginning</em></p>
<h1>Collaboration</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You’re considering the possibility of working with other musicians but aren’t
  sure how to proceed. What do you look for in a collaborator? What should their
  role be in the creative process?
</p>
<p>
  Musical collaboration can be a hugely rewarding catalyst for creativity, in
  which the resulting music is more than the sum of the individuals who made it.
  But establishing the <i>right </i>collaboration is critical; working with the
  wrong partner can be more painful than working alone. Here are some tips for
  finding great musical partners.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  When deciding on a partner for musical collaboration, the most important
  consideration is simply whether or not the partnership will result in better
  and/or more music. It’s tempting to imagine that your best friend will also be
  your ideal musical partner, but personal compatibility and professional
  compatibility aren’t necessarily
</p>
<p>
  related. Sure, the process will likely be more fun if you’re working with
  someone with whom you have a good social connection. But many personal
  relationships have been destroyed by attempting to extend them into
  professional relationships; if the professional one fails, the personal one
  might as well. If your best friend happens to also have
</p>
<p>
  a strong work ethic and great musical and technical skills, then the
  partnership might make sense. But if not, consider partnering with someone
  else. Of course, even the most talented musician isn’t going to work out in
  the long run if they’re a horrible person. But when in doubt, aim for
  professional compatibility first and social compatibility second.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever possible, try to work with people who can counterbalance your
  strengths and weaknesses. The most obvious example is the classic “producer
  plus vocalist” partnership. The producer deals with all of the musical and
  technical aspects of the song, while the vocalist brings a particular talent
  that the producer simply doesn’t have. Beyond this obvious example, try to
  find partners who are good at a particular aspect of the production process
  that you’re bad at or that you dislike. For example, if you have trouble with
  arrangements,
</p>
<p>
  try to find a partner who excels at them. If you’re good at sound design and
  synth programming, don’t worry too much about finding a partner who also has
  these skills (although two completely well-rounded collaborators might be the
  ideal package).
</p>

<p>
  Although the traditional model of collaboration involves multiple musicians in
  the same studio, recent technological advancements also make it possible to
  collaborate with people remotely, and possibly even anonymously. For example,
  the classic model of the studio musician has changed in recent years, and many
  session musicians who used to show up for recording studio dates are now
  tracking parts for a variety of projects from their home studios, sometimes
  without ever meeting the artists for whom they’re recording. This type of
  workflow is even easier for electronic musicians, because there’s no need for
  acoustic treatment, microphone setups, etc. For example, perhaps you have an
  idea for a synth part that’s beyond your ability to play. Using remote
  collaboration tools, you might find someone to record the part you need and
  deliver it back to you, entirely online.
</p>
<p>
  Once you’ve found a good collaborative situation, it’s important that everyone
  involved understands exactly how things like workload, money, ownership, and
  creative rights are to be divided. Misunderstandings can result in a lot of
  misery for all parties, so it’s best to have clear conversations and real,
  mutual understanding as early as possible.
