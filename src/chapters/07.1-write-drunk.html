<h1>"Write drunk; edit sober"</span></h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
    Sometimes during music-making, we find moments of amazing creativity and flow.
    But because we have in mind the ultimate end goal of “a great track,” we
    sometimes stop mid-flow to edit, correct, or otherwise disrupt the creation
    process. And once we do, it can be difficult to get back into the flow.</p>
<p>
    Creativity is an intrinsically messy and uninhibited process. Editing, on the
    other hand, is about refinement and order. “Write drunk; edit sober”—a quote
    often attributed (most likely incorrectly) to author Ernest Hemingway—uses
    drunkenness versus sobriety as a metaphor about levels of self-control and the
    importance of working both with and without restraint. Both modes of working
    are necessary to create something good, but problems can arise when we don’t
    keep a clear division between the two. Allowing them to overlap runs the risk
    of breaking our creative flow.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
    Force yourself to compartmentalize your work into two discrete phases. During
    the <i>creation phase</i>, your goal should be to capture as much material as
    possible. Only move forward in time. Delete nothing. Once you’ve recorded
    something, consider it finished. Better yet, forget about it entirely and move
    on to the next thing. Aim for speed and quantity, judge nothing, and be
    prepared to make lots of mistakes.
</p>
<p>
    Once you’ve captured a lot of material (maybe after a set amount of time, or
    simply once you get bored) switch to the <i>editing phase</i>. Now, your goal
    is to carefully refine the material that you generated during the creation
    phase. Resist the urge to generate anything new during this process, and
    instead ruthlessly delete, trim, reorder, or otherwise curate the material you
    made earlier. It’s likely that you’ll throw away the majority of what you
    made, and this is healthy. Most of what we make in a truly judgment-free
    creation mindset is likely to be terrible.
</p>
<p>
    A side benefit of working so freely during the creation phase is that you may
    find things during the <i>editing </i><a href="#bookmark107" class="a">phase that are actually amazing but are
        unusable within the context of the
        project you’re currently working on. When that happens, just save the
        material that’s worth saving (but is wrong for the current song) into a
        “scraps” folder (see Scraps and Sketches (page </a>74)). Then the next time you’re beginning a new
</p>
<p>
    track but aren’t in the mood to start from scratch, simply pull something
    interesting out of your scraps folder. Depending on how developed your scraps
    are, you might be able to pick one up and move directly into a new editing
    phase.
</p>
<p>
    A good technical approach to working during the creation phase is to always be
    recording. Even if you’re just improvising at the keyboard and have no plan or
    direction, be sure to capture every note you play. A common working method for
    electronic musicians is to use the DAW as the recording device but use
    hardware or other sources outside of the computer to generate sound. A
    collection of synthesizers generating MIDI and/or audio lets you get your
    hands on something that doesn’t
</p>

<p>
    feel like an editing environment, allowing you to step away from the DAW (and
    its inherent bias towards editing). Press record, then play and tweak knobs,
    capturing everything you do as a kind of free-form jam. While jamming, try to
    forget that you’re recording. Don’t try to make something perfect. Simply
    indulge in the uninhibited freedom of exploring sound. Follow your
    instincts—if something is working, let that lead you in a direction. If
    something isn’t working, abandon it, but do
</p>
<p>
    so <i>without </i>stopping the recording. The trick is to stay out of judgment
    mode as much as possible. Simply capture as much as you can, following your
    instinctive sense of what’s right. Don’t worry about hard drive space. If you
    really need to reclaim the space, you can do that later during the editing
    phase.
</p>
<p>
    Even if you work entirely in the computer, try to find some working methods
    that are somehow analogous to this physical division between instruments and
    editors. For example, maybe use one DAW as your creation space and another as
    your editing space. By treating these as distinct virtual environments, it may
    be easier to switch between the two modes of working. Alternatively, find a
    collection of instruments and effects that allow you to create lots of
    material in an evolving, organic, connected way. For example, modular
    synthesizers and arpeggiators, even virtual ones, can be great sources of
    material during the creation phase. Start your recording even before you’ve
    started building a modular patch, so that you can catch any happy accidents
    that occur on the way.
</p>
<p>
    If your DAW allows for comprehensive routing options between tracks, try
    capturing both MIDI and audio simultaneously during the creation phase. This
    will give you more ways to edit later and provide more
</p>
<p>
    raw fodder for refinement. It will also save time in the editing process
    because you don’t have to listen to everything twice—the MIDI and audio will
    contain analogous information, so you can listen through a single pass and
    then decide whether to rework the MIDI, the audio, or both.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#bookmark168" class="a">The balance between play (creation) and work (editing) is necessary to
        generate good results. Like Subtractive Arranging </a>(page 259),
</p>
<p>
    this approach works because it allows you to remove rather than create, and
    it’s much easier to decide that something is bad once it exists than it is to
    make something good from nothing. It saves you from having to make the “right”
    thing the first time, when you may be struggling to simply make anything at
    all.

    ~ Note: I wrote the first draft of this chapter in a text editor with an
    option called “Hemingway Mode,” which disables the Delete key. At the end of
    the creation phase, it was nearly 2000 words long. After editing, it’s about
    half that, and the paragraphs are almost completely reordered.
