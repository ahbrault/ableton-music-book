    <h1>The Rhythm of Automation</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      You know that you can use automation to give more motion to your music,
      but you’re not sure how to use it effectively or creatively. You end up
      falling back on the same standard patterns: long, smooth filter sweeps,
      slow, steady pitch rises, or simple adjustments to mix parameters to keep
      the parts in balance over the course of the arrangement. What are some
      ways that you can make more creative use of automation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Automation is perhaps most commonly used to precisely sculpt a mix to
      ensure that levels will be perfectly balanced at all points of the song.
      But automation can be used for so much more than just simulating an
      engineer’s hands on the mixer faders. Here are some ideas for using
      automation to add an additional layer of rhythmic interest to your music.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Most of the time, automation is recorded in real time; the producer moves
      a fader or knob as the transport runs, and the motion of that control is
      captured as a series of points that approximates a curve that is generally
      smooth. The resulting automation envelope may look something like this:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="509"
              height="81"
              src="/images/chapters/54-the-rhythm-of-automation/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The overall shape here looks like something you’d imagine a human would
      make; there are occasionally somewhat “sharp” changes, but there are no
      <i>instant </i>ones. Also, there seems to be no real relationship between
      the automation envelope and either the underlying metric grid or the note
      events. It looks like something that was created by moving a physical
      control by hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there’s no reason why automation envelopes can’t have fundamentally
      different properties. If automation is created by manually placing
      breakpoints or envelope segments at specific metric positions, the
      resulting envelope will have a dramatically different character.
    </p>
    <p>Contrast the previous example with this one:</p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="515"
              height="52"
              src="/images/chapters/54-the-rhythm-of-automation/image-2.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      The sharp edges and instant changes look more like the waveforms used in
      synthesis than they do any kind of conventional parameter envelope. This
      is an envelope that is inherently <i>rhythmic</i>. By using envelopes like
      this, you can add an additional layer of activity that serves as a
      counterpoint to the rhythm created by the note or audio events themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhythmic envelopes probably don’t make sense for all types of parameter
      automation. For example, real-time recordings of parameter changes will
      probably work best for things like the final mix adjustments, in which
      you’re just trying to control the relative volume balance of the various
      parts. But for any creative applications—synth parameters, filter or other
      effects settings, or even panning—you might find that you get more
      interesting results by using automation envelopes that are rhythmic.
