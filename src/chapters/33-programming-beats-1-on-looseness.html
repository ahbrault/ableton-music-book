<h1>Programming Beats 1: On Looseness</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  Your programmed drum beats just don’t have the right feel. When you play them
  in by hand, they sound sloppy. But when you program them with the mouse or by
  quantizing your manual playing, they sound too perfect.
</p>
<p>
  In certain genres of electronic music (like some techno, house, electro, and
  EDM) absolute quantization is completely appropriate for the style. It’s
  common to hear drum parts in these styles with both perfect timing and
  completely consistent and unvarying dynamics.
</p>
<p>
  But for other styles (like most hip-hop), a looser, more organic feel is often
  more appropriate. In much of this music, drum parts are often directly sampled
  from recordings of real drummers. So in songs where programmed drums are
  desired instead, it often makes sense to try to emulate the human feel that
  comes naturally to actual humans. But while humanness isn’t a characteristic
  that comes naturally to machines, many beat programmers don’t have the
  drumming skills to program convincing drum parts that sound like something a
  real drummer would play. Here are some ideas that can help you with your beat
  programming, whether you’re a drummer or not.
</p>

<h2>Solutions:</h2>

<p class="s7">Apply Quantization in Small Amounts</p>
<p>
  Most modern DAWs provide controls that allow you to change the intensity or
  amount of quantization applied, usually represented as a percentage. For
  example, if you’re quantizing to sixteenth notes at 100% quantization, the
  selected notes will be moved forward or backward from their current position
  to the nearest sixteenth note.
</p>
<p>
  But quantizing to 50% will move the notes only half of the distance between
  their original position and the nearest “correct” note position. This means
  that human inaccuracies will be reduced rather than eliminated. This technique
  is probably the best way to retain a sense of human feel while still allowing
  you to correct for some sloppiness in your playing.
</p>

<p class="s7">Apply Quantization to Only Certain Instruments</p>
<p>
  After recording a drum pattern with a MIDI controller, the typical approach is
  to apply quantization to the entire pattern, which means that all of the
  instruments in the drum kit will be shifted as a single unit. Instead of this,
  try selecting and quantizing only some of the instruments in the kit, leaving
  the others exactly as you played them. For example, try quantizing only the
  hi-hats, leaving the kick and snare alone. Or try the inverse, leaving the
  hi-hats loose but quantizing the kick and snare so that they’re perfectly in
  time. Although any perfect quantization is not really a representation of how
  a real drummer would play, this technique can result in much more
  realistic-sounding drum patterns. You can also combine this technique with the
  previous one for even more possibilities.
</p>

<p class="s7">Find Your “Natural” Tempo</p>
<p>
  A common technique when programming drum patterns in real time is to record at
  a slow tempo and then increase the tempo during playback. While it’s true that
  it may be easier to play accurately at slower tempos, there’s usually a bottom
  limit to this, and most drummers (and non-drummers) find that their rhythm is
  most accurate within a particular range of tempos—not too slow, and not too
  fast.
</p>
<p>
  This range varies from person to person however, and if you hope to improve
  your beat programming, experiment to find the tempos that work best for you.
  Once you’ve found something that feels comfortable, try programming your beats
  here and see if you can get the feel you want without applying any
  quantization afterwards. Keep in mind that timing errors are generally more
  perceptible if you play back at a slower tempo than you recorded, and less
  perceptible if you play back faster.
</p>

<p class="s7">Humanize/Randomize</p>
<p>
  In addition to adjusting how much you quantize after recording, you can also
  sometimes get very musical results by applying “humanization” (subtle timing
  and/or velocity randomization) to your material. Even if you’ve quantized
  something to lock completely to the grid, humanization provides a way to
  reverse this effect, placing notes some distance away from the quantized
  positions according to whatever algorithm your DAW uses for this process. Note
  that applying randomization to material that <i>hasn’t </i>been quantized will
  likely just exaggerate any timing inaccuracies that were already there; this
  process usually works best with material that’s exactly on the grid.
</p>

<p class="s7">Adjusting Velocity Instead Of/In Addition to Timing</p>
<p class="s31">
  Although timing is the most important variable that determines the feel of
  drum patterns, the relative volumes (velocities) of individual notes can also
  have a significant effect. For example, a hi-hat pattern in straight sixteenth
  notes sounds quite different if all of the velocities are identical than it
  does if there is some variation in volume from note to note. Most drummers
  will play a pattern like this with a slight emphasis on the first and third
  sixteenths, while playing slightly quieter on the second and fourth:
</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The image above shows a hi-hat pattern with perfect quantization but with
  velocities similar to what a drummer might play. Even without adjusting timing
  at all, you can often make a stiff, static groove come to life by carefully
  adjusting some of the velocities.
</p>

<p class="s7">Manually Shift Specific Elements</p>
<p>
  Both for quantized and unquantized material, the surefire way to get the
  results you want is also the most time-consuming. Manually editing individual
  notes to change their relationship to each other and to the metric grid can
  ensure that everything happens exactly where you want it. Unfortunately, this
  assumes that you know what you’re looking for, which may not be the case. Here
  are some ideas:
</p>
<ul id="l24">
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Try dragging some or all of the snare drum or hi-hat notes slightly after
      their “intended” grid positions to create a heavy or “laid- back” feel.
      You’ll often hear this “behind the beat” approach in funk drumming. Here’s
      an example of hi-hats placed slightly after the beat:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img width="510" height="174" src="/images/chapters/33-programming-beats-1-on-looseness/image-2.webp">
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li data-list-text=">">
    <p>
      Conversely, placing them early can make the music sound nervous or
      “driving forward.” You’ll often hear ska or punk drummers play “ahead of
      the beat.” Here’s an example of hi-hats placed slightly before the beat.
      Note that the “first” note has been moved to the end of the pattern, so
      that it plays slightly before the loop point.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="510" height="172" src="/images/chapters/33-programming-beats-1-on-looseness/image-3.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  How far to move the notes is entirely up to you; there’s no formula for this.
  Very small shifts tend to work well at slower tempos, while you’ll need to
  make more drastic changes as the tempo increases. But in general, even a
  little bit of distance from the grid can be very effective.
</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind that if you move <i>every </i>instrument together, the listener
  won’t hear any change. These subtle shifts are only audible if they occur in
  relation to other elements that have not been moved.
