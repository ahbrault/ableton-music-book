<h1>Harmonic Rhythm</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  You have a number of great-sounding chords assembled together into a great-
  sounding chord progression. But you can’t seem to find the right speed to move
  from one chord to the next. You’re quite happy with the rhythm of the music
  itself, but this doesn’t seem to offer any clues for how to control the speed
  of the harmonic changes.
</p>
<p>
  The rate at which the chords change in a piece of music is called the
  <i>harmonic rhythm</i>. This is a separate concept from the rhythm of
</p>
<p>
  individual notes and other events, which we can refer to as the
  <i>surface rhythm</i>. There is not necessarily any relationship between the
  surface rhythm and the harmonic rhythm. For example, it’s certainly possible
  to have very active, fast surface rhythms that repeat or outline a single
  chord for a long time before changing to the next one.
</p>

<p>
  Such a piece would have a slow harmonic rhythm. In the example below, a highly
  active, syncopated sixteenth-note pattern creates a fast surface rhythm. But
  the chords change only once per bar:

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  Likewise, we could have slow music but with a chord change on every note. This
  would likely result in a relatively fast harmonic rhythm. In the example
  below, the surface rhythm moves in quarter notes. But the chords also change
  once every quarter note. The result is a harmonic rhythm that’s four times
  faster than the previous example but with a slower surface rhythm, resulting
  in a slower apparent rate of activity.

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>
  Here are some ideas for how to use harmonic rhythm in interesting ways in your
  own music.
</p>

<h2>Solutions:</h2>

<p>
  The examples discussed earlier are actually fairly common patterns that govern
  the relationship between surface rhythm and harmonic rhythm. As a general (but
  by no means universal) rule, music with a faster surface rhythm tends to have
  a slower harmonic rhythm, and vice versa. For example, if the instruments that
  define the harmony are moving in fast notes (like sixteenths), you’ll
  generally get good results if the harmonic rhythm moves more slowly (perhaps
  one chord per bar), while if those instruments are moving in slow notes (like
  quarters), you might consider a faster harmonic rhythm (like one chord per
  beat or two beats).
</p>
<p>
  Another interesting way to use harmonic rhythm is to vary it to create new
  formal sections. For example, for your bridge or breakdown section, you might
  use the same basic chord progression that you used in a verse or chorus, but
  at half the speed. In this case, it might also be interesting to slow down the
  surface rhythm as well, to create a sense of anticipation before returning to
  the original pace when returning to the “main” sections of the track.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="#bookmark176" class="a">Conversely, you might want to think about speeding up the harmonic rhythm
    as a way to end the song. For example, if your last section repeats a
    four-bar chord progression, try condensing the same progression into two
    bars to give a greater sense of forward motion. (This is a variation on the
    ideas discussed in Short Loops as Endings (page </a>275).)
</p>
<p>
  ~ Note: Harmonic rhythm is only affected by instruments that actually
  contribute to the harmony. Drums and other non-pitched instruments, for
  example, have no relevance here. It is certainly possible to have fast
  rhythmic activity in the drums while also having very slow rhythmic activity
  in pitched instruments. In this case, you will probably only want to consider
  the sonic effect of the pitched instruments when thinking about your harmonic
  rhythm.
