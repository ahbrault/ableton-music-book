    <h1>Foreground, Middle Ground, and Background</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      Your music has a feeling of “flatness” or two-dimensionality that is
      somewhat difficult to explain. The music that inspires you definitely
      doesn’t suffer from this, although you find it equally difficult to
      express what it is, specifically, that’s more satisfying about those
      inspiring songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, we think of different instruments and/or voices in a song as
      having different levels of prominence. And we probably have some
      instinctive ideas about how to reinforce these levels of prominence when
      working on a mix. For example, important sounds are typically mixed louder
      than less important ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      But creating a sense of varied “depth” in music is more complicated than
      just applying basic mixing rules. By thinking about depth even during the
      composition phase, we can complement our mixing decisions and create an
      even stronger sense that each element is fulfilling a specific functional
      role.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      The notion of foreground, middle ground, and background are well known to
      anyone who works in the visual arts: film, photography, painting, etc. In
      visual art, these layers refer to objects at different physical distances
      from the viewer’s eye.

    <p>
      Typically, the objects in the foreground are the ones with the most
      prominence. In a photograph, for example, foreground objects are commonly
      the “subject” of the composition. They’re often in focus, and we can see
      the complexity and fine detail. The background, on the other hand,
      contains objects in the far distance. We recognize them, but they might be
      blurry or otherwise less rich in detail. The middle ground contains
      everything else—objects which are generally not the primary focus of our
      attention but which are closer (and thus more prominent) than those in the
      background.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a technical or production level, this concept can also be applied to an
      audio recording, and this is what mix engineers refer to when they talk
      about the “depth” of a mix. For example, sounds can be made to seem closer
      to the listener by making them louder, “brighter” (an increase in
      high-frequency content in comparison to other sounds), and/or “dryer” (an
      increase in the amount of original, unprocessed signal in comparison to
      the amount of reverb applied to that signal). Likewise, sounds can be
      placed in the background by making them quieter, darker, or more
      reverberant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even before the mixing stage, we can think of our musical elements
      themselves as being divided into foreground, middle ground, and
      background. For example, in a track with a singer, we usually want the
      voice to be the most important element. We can try to force this to happen
      when mixing, but we can also make musical decisions to enhance the effect.
      For example, imagine a scenario in which the vocal melody is doubled note
      for note by a synth line that plays an octave higher. Our ears are
      naturally drawn to the highest sound in a mix, so we might subconsciously
      hear the synth line as the dominant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an even more extreme example, imagine that our accompanying synth
      didn’t double the voice but instead played a line that was more
      complicated, with faster rhythms, jagged jumps from note to note, etc. We
      would probably hear this as still more prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tend to hear things as being in the foreground if they’re <i>high</i>,
      <i>loud</i>, <i>fast</i>, or <i>subject to a rapid rate of change</i>. For
      example, the drum groove of a song is often quite loud in comparison to
      the rest of the mix. But because it’s also generally consistent and
      unvarying in relation to the other voices, we’re able to place it in its
      appropriate place in the texture: the middle ground or background. When a
      drum fill happens, however, the sudden change in textural density and
      complexity causes us to switch our focus to the drums; they temporarily
      jump to the foreground.
    </p>

    <p>
      When writing music, try to think about where each element should reside on
      this three-layered depth chart of foreground, middle ground, and
      background. Draw the elements in a box like the one in the previous
      picture if it helps you to visualize. Or simpler yet, just make a list.
      Here’s an example of what a list of song parts for a minimal techno track
      might look like if divided into foreground/middle ground/ background:
    </p>
    <p class="s7">Foreground</p>
    <ul id="l19">
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>Pitch-shifted spoken text (irregular, mostly non-rhythmic)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>Metal clang “interruptions” (irregular, high-pitched, loud)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="s7">Middle ground</p>
    <ul id="l19">
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>Synth bleeps (medium pitch, repeating patterns)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>Synth marimba chords (medium pitch, repeating patterns)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>
          Acid bass line (medium pitch, repeating patterns; sometimes comes to
          foreground via brighter filter settings, variations in the pattern)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="s7">Background</p>
    <ul id="l19">
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>Drums (steady-state)</p>
      </li>
      <li data-list-text=">">
        <p>Sub bass (steady-state, low pitch)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each element in the list is followed by decisions about musical parameters
      which will help to reinforce the selected depth. The rate of change in the
      middle ground and background elements is kept to a minimum, while
      foreground elements are allowed more freedom of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, try to experiment with making temporary changes in the depth
      at which certain voices reside, as in the drum fill example mentioned
      before. By varying the depth of elements in a song, we also draw attention
      to the fact that we’re using depth in the first place, which helps to
      reinforce the overall effect.
