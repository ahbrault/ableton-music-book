    <h1>Multiple Simultaneous Melodies</h1>

    <h2>Problem:</h2>

    <p class="s16">
      In some music, you hear bass lines that are so detailed and interesting
      that they almost take on the quality of a melody. But when you try to do
      this in your own music, the parts collide and overlap in ways that just
      sound like a mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of two or more intricate, independent, simultaneous
      melodies in a composition is called <i>counterpoint</i>. Here are some
      tips for how to use counterpoint effectively in your own work.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution:</h2>

    <p>
      Counterpoint is an old practice, and music with independent melodic lines
      has been written and studied for hundreds of years. There are very strict
      rules for writing “correct” counterpoint in ancient styles of music, and
      although music today is generally less strict in all ways, we can still
      take advantage of some of these rules if we want to write interesting
      counterpoint in contemporary music.
    </p>
    <p>
      One example of counterpoint that you’ve probably come across is the
      <i>round</i>, a type of composition in which the same melody occurs in
      multiple parts but starting at different times. The children’s songs
      <i>Row, Row, Row Your Boat </i>and <i>Frère Jacques </i>are examples of
      rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically, any music with multiple monophonic parts (such as a melody
      and a bass line) could be considered counterpoint. But in most music,
      there is one clearly dominant melody while the bass line is much more
      rhythmically static or serves only to support the harmony (or both). We
      wouldn’t normally refer to this type of music as counterpoint because the
      parts aren’t given equal importance. True counterpoint (or at least good
      counterpoint) assumes that any of the parts involved in the counterpoint
      could function as a standalone melody even without the presence of the
      other parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting example of counterpoint in electronic music is the Boards
      of Canada track “Roygbiv.” The bass line is so intricate that, on first
      hearing, a listener might assume that it is really the track’s melody.
      Only after the bass line has been repeated several times does the “real”
      melody finally enter. Here is a composite of the two parts:
    </p>

    <p><span> </span></p>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <img
              width="511"
              height="139"
              src="/images/chapters/44-multiple-simultaneous-melodies/image-1.webp"
            />
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>And here is the same composite in musical notation:</p>
    <img
      src="/images/chapters/44-multiple-simultaneous-melodies/image-2.webp"
    />

    <p>
      There are a few specific aspects to this counterpoint that make it so
      effective and that can serve as good guidelines for your own work:
    </p>
    <h4>
      Make sure that each part’s rhythm is independent of the other parts.
      <span class="p"
        >When parts move from note to note at the same time, our ears tend to
        hear the result as chords. The independence of the horizontal lines is
        lost, and we hear the vertical result instead. Successful counterpoint
        does result in good chords, but this is secondary to the melodic aspect.
        Notice how this is applied in the Boards of Canada example. With the
        exception of certain downbeats, each voice only moves to a new note when
        the other voice is sustaining.</span
      >
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Use contrary motion.
      <span class="p"
        >As a general guideline, counterpoint works best when the voices mostly
        move in opposite directions; one voice moves up while the other moves
        down. This is known as <i>contrary motion</i>.
      </span>
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Be careful when crossing voices.
      <span class="p"
        >In this example, each part stays within its own range of pitches, never
        crossing into the range of the other. This is straightforward here
        because the counterpoint is between a high melody and a low bass line.
        But in some cases, you might write two parts that could potentially
        cross each other. Brief voice crossings are generally not problematic,
        but if the parts are consistently winding around each other, they can
        lose their sense of independence. If you do want the voices to cross
        while still retaining their identity, try making the timbres of the
        parts highly distinct.</span
      >
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not all music benefits from these techniques. In some cases, one melody—or
      even none—is enough. But if you’re looking for ways to generate more
      complexity in your music, counterpoint might be a nice option.
