<h1>Parallel Harmony</h1>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p class="s16">
  There’s a certain quality to the chord progressions in a lot of deep house,
  post- dubstep, and related styles that seems to be difficult to replicate in
  your own music.
</p>
<p>
  Harmony in house music and its variants is often a tricky thing to dissect.
  The chord progressions are often quite repetitive but also seem strangely
  alien—they sound quite different from the way harmonic relationships work in
  any other music. Here is one way to unlock some of what’s going on for use in
  your own music.
</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>
  A lot of house music chord progressions use a technique called
  <i>parallel harmony</i>, which refers to a method of moving from one chord to
  another in which each note moves by the same number of semitones and in the
  same direction. Parallel harmony is essentially what you would get if you
  copied a chord, pasted it somewhere else, and then transposed the copy. For
  example, here’s a chord progression (Cm7- Fm7-Gm7-B<span class="s18">b</span>m7) constructed using parallel harmony:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="515" height="227" src="/images/chapters/51-parallel-harmony/image-1.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <a href="#bookmark152" class="a">If you try to play this on a keyboard, you’ll notice that you need to move
    your hand somewhat far to get from one chord to the next. A trained keyboard
    player might instead re-voice these chords to minimize hand movement,
    preserve notes that are shared between adjacent chords, and improve the
    Voice Leading (page </a>225).
</p>

<p>
  Starting with the same voicing for the first chord, a more typical voicing of
  this progression might be something like:
</p>

<p><span> </span></p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img width="515" height="228" src="/images/chapters/51-parallel-harmony/image-2.webp">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  But while traditional music theory would probably call the second version
  “better” than the first, the parallel version has a distinct sound which has
  found a place in a lot of electronic music. There are a number of technical
  and historical reasons for this, and you can use these techniques in your own
  music as well:
</p>

<p class="s7">Sampled Chords</p>
<p>
  In house music, a common technique for creating harmony is to sample a single
  interesting chord from another song. As with sampled breakbeats, the source
  for these single chords is often classic soul or jazz tracks. By then playing
  the sampled chord at different pitches, the resulting harmony moves in
  parallel.
</p>

<p class="s7">Chord Memory</p>
<p>
  A number of classic polyphonic synths from the 80s had a feature called “chord
  memory,” which was essentially an automatic parallel harmony generator. To use
  chord memory, the user would hold down a chord and press the chord memory
  button. After this, playing a single note on the keyboard would play the
  memorized chord, transposed as necessary. Many modern DAWs offer
  chord-generating MIDI processing tools that allow you to achieve a similar
  effect by automatically adding one or more notes (at specific intervals) to
  whichever note is played manually. This allows you to use any plug-in
  instrument to achieve parallel harmony.
